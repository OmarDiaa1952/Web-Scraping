That's great. ,Nobody watches movies anymore these days.,Hey, hey, hey, hey.,Ah, this is ""Raihun"" (title of a movie).,Do you know it if you watch it?,Anna, a country girl, was deceived ,by a man and had a miscarriage.,She hides the truth and ,works as a maid for a living.,But she gets exposed and ,gets kicked out in the heavy snow.,Lilian Gish, who plays Anna, ,is so beautiful, so I remember.,What the... I've made up,my mind to burn the film reels.,This theater was built by my grandfather, ,probably in the Taisho era.,""Raihun"" was released in Tokyo in 1922.,The following year, this theater was established.,My grandfather watched that film in Tokyo,and decided to screen it as, the first film at Asahi Theater.,How can we burn such an important film?,If we don't burn this important film, ,how can we make up our minds?,They say a grocery store ,can survive for three generations.,There's no choice. ,Times change, you know?,Times change?,If this place disappears, ,where will the locals watch movies?,Who should I ask if you ask me?,It has survived many disasters ,over the past century, even earthquakes.,That means this theater ,shouldn't disappear even more.,In the end, it was defeated, by the COVID-19 pandemic.,It will take another year or, two to return to normal life.,It can't hold on for that long.,Relying on donations... and such?,We don't accept donations. ,They should go to other theaters, right?,It would be meaningful if other, theaters could be saved.,That's how I convinced myself and ,made up my mind to burn the film reels.,Alright?

Go sightseeing then.,I'm not here for sightseeing.,Then why are you here?,I'm here... to rebuild this theater.,Huh?,Someone asked me to find an ,old man with a beer belly...,Um... that is... to find the person in charge here.,They said the venue is good, but the film ,lineup is lousy, and they asked me to rebuild it.,You're really stubborn, old man.,What's with the ""old man"" attitude?,Well, you're an old man. ,What's wrong with calling you that?,Shut up, kid. I'm not playing around.,I'm not playing around... ah!,By the way, who are you?,It doesn't matter who I am.,It does matter. ,Being pointed at by a stranger...,You better give me your name, ,or I'll call the police.,Mogi...,Mogi?,Mogi Riko ,(sounds like ""ticket collector"" in Japanese).,Right, Mogi Riko.,I'm Mogi Riko.,My real name is Asahi Hamano.,Hamano as in ""seaside"" and ""field."",During my first year of high school, ,the Great East Japan Earthquake happened.,My dad used to work at, a taxi company in Koriyama.,But all transportation companies, were afraid of radiation,and didn't send cars for decontamination workers.,So, he decided to go to Minamisoma ,alone to be in charge of transportation.,Gasoline was scarce, ,and natural gas taxis were in high demand.,At first, he received praise,,but when it was known that he made a lot of money,,people's attitudes changed, and they accused him, of profiting from the national disaster.,His company was called ,""Hamano Asahi Transportation."",And my name, including both my first ,and last names, was associated with it.,As a result, my family faced harassment.,My mother and younger brother, ,who stayed in Koriyama, were also ostracized.,Our family was on the verge of falling apart.,Because of those rumors,,I lost all my friends. ,They all left me like the receding tide.,Hey.,How did you get the key to the rooftop?,You can't go up there without ,permission from the teachers.,-Sorry. ,-Hmm.,So... how did you get the key?,I... made a spare.,Huh?,I also have a spare key.,This place is nice for some alone time.,But... it's not good if you jump from here.,What's with that expression?,Why...,I've seen you before.,And you're kind of famous at our school too.,Every time, you look like you want to die.,Today, seeing you like that, ,I had to stop you.,It's like I'm the monitor for ,the cliffs of Toshinbo or something.,It's up to you how you want to do it; ,it's your freedom.,But now is also my precious time to relax.,If someone jumps off a building in front of me, ,it will be traumatizing for my soul.,I heard you're transferring to another school?,Where are you transferring to?,Tokyo.,Tokyo is great. ,I used to live there.,It has everything and is very convenient.,But I don't want to go.,Maybe it's better than living ,here with no friends.,I've been here for years, ,and I still have two more to go.,I feel really sorry about it.,But... the world is not just this place, ,you know?,Come with me.,This place is perfect for secretly watching movies.,Here we are.,Hey, Tanaka-sensei. ,Are you using this room?,Sorry, Principal. I'm tutoring a student.,Okay, I just saw the door was unlocked.,Goodbye.,Take care.,That was close.

The Inbetweeners (2011) - full transcript,"Best friends Will McKenzie, Simon Cooper, Jay Cartwright and Neil Sutherland - who are not among the social outcasts, but also not cool enough to hang out with the cool kids who they aspire to be - have just graduated from their suburban London high school. Simon has finally been able to get Carli D'Amato, who he has been in love with since they were children, to be his girlfriend. Largely because they will be going away to different schools in the fall, Carli breaks up with him. To get Simon's singularly focused mind off Carli, his three best mates decide to take him on vacation for two weeks to get some sun, sand and girls before they move onto the next chapter of their lives in the fall. Neil makes the decision for them to go to Malia on the isle of Crete, a popular summer tourist destination for many a Brit. Jay, with inheritance money in hand, believes he can have the pick of any girl he wants. Neil has to decide what constitutes not cheating on his girlfriend, Nicole. Will wants to add a bit of culture into the vacation. And Simon still pines for Carli, getting her off his mind being more difficult when he learns why Neil chose Malia. What starts off as a disastrous vacation has the potential to pick up when they meet fellow Brits Alison, Lucy, Jane and Lisa, who pair up with Will, Simon, Jay and Neil respectively, and with who they hang, out of circumstance, for much of their time in Malia. Will the virgin, who generally makes Alison laugh, has no chance with her as she is far out of his league, and as she is already in a serious relationship with a Greek waiter named Nicos. Jay is ashamed to be seen with self-assured Jane, because she is overweight. Neil treats Lisa like any other female with who he wants to have non-cheating ""sex"". And Simon may not see that Lucy really does like him despite his singular focus on Carli. All these issues are placed against the backdrop of the guys trying to get tickets for the all-day boat cruise, seen as the party of the season, and at which all their dreams - at least in their dreams - will come true.","api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please,implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com,So, you see the thing is, Dad,,I could reapply next year,,but if I defer and try again for Oxford,,I'll probably lose my place at Bristol...,Mm...,which is a good university,but not my dream.,Do you think,it matters in the long term,,or is the subject and standard of degree,more important?,So, I got married.,- What?!,- To Suzy, we got married.,You mean remarried.,This time it's for keeps, though.,
,
,
,- When did this happen?,- A few weeks ago.,I was going to invite you,,but I know how you are around people.,How am I?!,Awkward.

Well, not that long.,He shagged the work experience girl,and then left us.,So, just clichéd, really.,Plus, it only happened two years ago,,so I don't even get the luxury,of blaming my various personality defects,on their divorce.,Anyway, that's how I ended up here -,the very definition of suburbia.,Safe, comforting, stifling, boring -,and I couldn't wait to fucking leave.,Maybe that's unfair, as they do say,that you never know what goes on,behind the net curtains of suburbia.,Although, in my friend Jay Cartwright's,case, you can have a pretty good guess.,Are you ready to have some fun, big boy?,Mmm.,I'm feeling sexy!,Take off mask, baby, let me see you.,Nah.,Do you promise this'll be,properly filthy, yeah?,Oh, yes, like bomb explode from in penis.,Sexy like... mmm...,finger up bumhole.,Christ, you make me so erect.,Oh, yes, you also make me erect.,Now, put in card details.,Oh, I'm so horny.,Don't forget security number and bank.,Mm!

This isn't the Dead Poets Society,and I'm not that bloke on BBC Two,who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs.,I especially don't want to hear about,how well you're settling down at uni,or how much growing up you've done,in the past 12 months.,At best, I am ambivalent,towards most of you,,but some of you, I actively dislike,,for no other reason,than your poor personal hygiene,or your irritating personalities.,I hope I've made myself clear,on this point.,And in case any of you think,I'm joking... I'm not.,I assure you,that once my legal obligation...,to look after your best interests,is removed,,I can be one truly nasty fucker.,Good luck with the rest of your lives,and... try not to kill anyone.,It reflects very badly on all of us here.,Slightly more upbeat,than I was expecting.,They say your school days,are the best days of your life.,But the only way,that would be true for me...,would be if I went straight from school,to prison and stayed there until I died.,How many times is that,she's caught you now?,Four. But this was the worst.,Mask, snorkel, ham.,OK, one last one for luck.,Ooooh!,Good. Old-school wedgie.,To be admired, in a way.,Squashing the balls now.,Ooh! That does not tickle!,Argh!,Mark!

From now on, every time,you mention the Moanatronic 5000,,- you get a slap in the balls.,- Do you mean Carli?,Ow!

Simon!,I'm Simon.,I'd better not get stuck,with the fat one.,So, when Alison,initially suggested Malia,,we all thought,,yeah, why not?,It'll be ironic.,Then we had a reality check,and we thought, do we honestly wanna,spend 2 weeks somewhere being ironic,,and obviously the answer was no,,so then we looked at other places,,but we realised, actually,,we just wanna have a laugh,and go clubbing and get drunk...,and be silly, and that this might,genuinely be a good place to come,,so fuck it, here we are.,Just so you know, I've met a really,fit bird, and she'll be along any minute.,OK.

JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time (2014) - full transcript,"The Legion of Doom are attempting to use space satellites to freeze the Earth's oceans, creating more land mass at the coastal regions for which they own. The JLA quickly arrive and the two teams engage in a classic battle of wills. This clash leads to Lex Luthor becoming trapped in a glacier of ice. In the 31st century Legion of Superheroes trainees; Dawnstar and Karate Kid are tasked with minding the Legion's museum. Their tour leads them to Lex Luthor's memorial; his body still encased in a large chuck of ice discovered in the 29th century. Karate Kid Inadvertently frees Luthor who secretly explores the museum himself, and soon uncovers the shrine to his greatest nemesis Superman. There he learns of the Kent's involvement in Kal-El's discovery. Luthor following the voices of Dawnstar and Karate Kid takes possession of an hourglass which holds the Time Trapper within. Whoever holds the hourglass controls this entity who is the master of time. Luthor returns to the 21st century, but not without the young Legionaries close behind. The Legion of Doom regroups with a new plan in place; they will prevent the Kent's from ever raising Kal-El, and with no Superman the JLA will cease to exist as well. The JLA arrive but Luthor's efforts prove to be successful, and the Time Trapper causes the time paradoxes to vanish from this reality. Now it's up to Dawnstar and Karate Kid to stop Luthor's plans for worldwide dominance. They find a loophole freeing the Time Trapper from Luthor's control, but now nothing is preventing him from wrecking chaos throughout reality. The JLA return, but well their power combined with Dawnstar and Karate Kid prove to be enough to stop this new menace, or has our time just run out?","Do you want subtitles for any video?,-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-,Now is the hour...,...we set into motion cataclysmic change,to the planet.,The legion of doom shall rule,in a new world order.,No one can stop us.,I do not understand, Lex Luthor.,I thought we were melting the polar ice caps.,No, my dear cheetah, the exact opposite.,As those glaciers swell,,the world's water level shrinks...,...expanding the coastlines,of every continent.,Black manta:,Land we already own.,Another brilliant plan from a brilliant mind.,

My children ,Mama.. ,Mama.. ,Mama.. ,Mama.. ,Mama.. ,Mama.. ,Where had you gone away, Mama? - Where, Mama? ,Nowhere, my children.. ,..I'd never leave my children and go anywhere ,I will never leave you and go away.

Beyond the Edge (2013) - full transcript,Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary's monumental and historical ascent of Mt. Everest in 1953 - an event that stunned the world and defined a nation.,"(WIND WHISTLES),(GENTLE MUSIC),(SLOW, MUFFLED BREATHING),(MUSIC BUILDS),(STATIC ON RADIO),MAN ON RADIO:,Well, now, the Himalay as...,(STATIC),MAN ON RADIO:,Well, we introduce to you this morning,Ed Hillary, a very interesting,personality in the alpine world.,Good morning, Ed.,EDMUND HILLARY: Good morning.,How many attempts have been,made on Everest altogether?,
,
,
,Well, there have,been at least 10.,Well, why have,the others failed?,A combination of circumstances,which hasn't been right.,Well, do you think,it's possible to climb Everest?,Yes, I definitely think,it's possible to climb it,and, well, I'm sure,it will be done some day.,(RADIO STATIC),MAN: It's only 60 years ago, but,it was a completely different world,,and the idea that,you would be the first man,to stand on the highest,point on earth,is a quest, a romantic quest,,MAN 2: There was a real race on,for the world's highest peak,,And it wasn't just Britain,,There were other nations,in the queue,,
,
,
,This really was Britain's,last chance to grab this great prize,,(RISING MUSIC),MAN: Nobody knew if someone,could survive at 29,000 feet,,Like the guys going into space,,you know, you 're breaking frontiers,,MAN 2: There is a physiologic limit,of what human beings can take,,I'm sure they didn't want to die,,but you 're taking risks in which,death is one of the outcomes,,MAN: You are going into the unknown,,Could it be done?,Back in 1953, it was,a great big question mark,,EDMUND HILLARY: I think,it's all really a matter of challenge,,Not so much challenge,only with the mountain,,but challenge with oneself,,seeing if you can force yourself,to overcome your fears,and hopefully, ultimately,,get to the top,,(WONDROUS MUSIC),(NEWSREEL FANFARE),VOICEOVER: Members of,the British Everest expedition,have begun assembling,on the Subcontinent,where deputy leader Major Wylie,is looking forw ard,to the adventure to come.,We are very pleased,that the first stage,of our journey,to Mount Everest is over.,We are now off tow ards the hills.,If we get some fine weather,tow ards the end of May,just before the monsoon arrives,we should have a chance,of getting to the top.,(FANFARE CONTINUES),(PENSIVE MUSIC),(MEN CHATTER INAUDIBLY),The first time I joined up,with the expedition,was at the British Embassy,in Kathmandu,,We had 13 Western members,of the expedition,,John Hunt, a senior army officer,,was expedition leader,,I'd really never heard,of John Hunt before,and the first time I met him,was in Kathmandu,,MAN: I was very keen,to have people I knew already,so I had big,question marks about Ed,,I can only say that,from the moment I met Ed,I knew that here was somebody,who would be a dominating influence,,He was a tower of strength,,MAN ON RADIO: Mr Hillary,,as a matter of interest,,how long have you been climbing?,EDMUND HILLARY: Well,,I've been climbing, I suppose,,for altogether about 10 years.,And how many trips have you done,out of New Z ealand climbing?,I have already had a couple,of expeditions to the Himalay a.,INTERVIEWER: You were quite strictly,brought up, weren't you?,EDMUND HILLARY: I was brought up,during the Depression,and my family was pretty,short on cash during that period,,I was just a rough,old country boy, as it were,,INTERVIEWER: A beekeeper,,A beekeeper,,lused to wander around our farm,dreaming about great adventures,and climbing mountains,and all that sort of thing,,INTERVIEWER:,What a contrast between,beekeeping on the one hand,and climbing mountains,,EDMUND HILLARY: Oh, not really,,In the beekeeping, I was constantly,lugging around,80-pound boxes of honey,,And my brother was also,doing beekeeping, and we competed,,And I think the sense of competition,carried on to,my mountaineering activities,,MAN: Well, the party were first,all together as a team in Kathmandu,,Before us we had 17 days,of marches to Tengboche,,which is where we were going,to place our first base camp,,We had to cross a succession,of high ridges and deep valleys,,We could really get gradually fit,and - most important -,get to know each other as a team,,MAN: Everything had been,calculated to the last detail -,7,5 tons of material,,443 packages, all numbered,,and the contents of each listed,down to the last matchbox or needle,,EDMUND HILLARY:,It is a team expedition,and it's very much in the form,of a pyramid of effort,,13 Western members of the expedition,,30 permanent high-altitude Sherpas,,These are men who will be carrying,loads for us to great altitudes,,Some 600 Nepalese porters,carried loads across country,into our climbing regions,,MAN: Because there had been no less,than seven British,attempts on the mountain,,we felt that by right, the mountain,should be climbed by Britain,and by extension,the British Commonwealth,,The Swiss so nearly,got to the summit in 1952,,The Americans were,waiting in the wings,,And so there was huge,pressure on John Hunt,with this colossal expectation,that this quest had to succeed,,INTERVIEWER: Mr Hillary,,how many New Z ealanders,are in this year's expedition?,EDMUND HILLARY: Well, only two of,us. There's George Lowe and myself.,MAN: George Lowe and my father,were great friends,,They had climbed extensively,in the Southern Alps of New Zealand,,They were very good,climbers together,and had a tremendous rapport,,MAN 2: We had 18 days of trekking,and during that period,of getting to know one another,there was always,a little bit of a funny edge,towards the New Zealanders,,Both Ed and I had been,to ordinary high schools,,They, of course,,the greater number of them,,had been to public schools,,We did come from a different,background, there was no doubt,,HUNT: Kathmandu is only about,4,000 feet above sea level,,The foot of Everest is about 18,000,,Our 17 days approach march,was an essential part of my policy,of acclimatisation,,MAN: The whole thing,is a race against time,,There was a constant fear,that the monsoon would come,,So that's why John Hunt said,,""We want to be in a position,to climb Everest on May 15,"",The later in May, the more likely,that the monsoon would arrive,,It's always a race against time,,EDMUND HILLARY: As we got steadily,higher, our excitement increased,and more and more great peaks,were coming into view,,And over it all towered,the summit pyramid of Everest,only 20 miles away,,but still 20,000 feet above us,,INTERVIEWER: Mr Hillary, you started,climbing in New Z ealand, didn't you?,EDMUND HILLARY: Oh, yes,,I started in New Z ealand.,(ROMANTIC MUSIC ON NEWSREEL),NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER: And there's,Mount Cook, the 'Cloud Piercer',,reaching majestically skyw ard,for over 12,000 feet.,EDMUND HILLARY:,A friend and I decided,to have a short trip to Mount Cook,,The closer we got, the more impressed,I was with the magnificent mountains,,NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:,Those jagged peaks there,provide the real alpinist with some of,the best climbing outside Europe.,EDMUND HILLARY: That night, inside,the Hermitage where I was staying,,two young men came in,,I heard the whisper go around -,""They have just climbed Mount Cook,"",These chaps were really living,,I felt, ""What a hopeless life I lead,,""no great adventures,,nothing particularly exciting,"",And that's when I decided that I was,going to take up mountaineering,,HUNT: Well, after 17 days,our caravans arrived at the Monastery of,Tengboche at over 12,000 feet,,PETER HILLARY: Once they got up,to Tengboche Monastery,it's getting pretty cold,,The low-country porters,largely only had cotton clothes,so they get paid off,and they return to their villages,and Sherpa porters take over,,The Sherpas who stay,on the expedition,might have had previous,experience of climbing,,although not many did,,Tenzing was an exception to that,in that he did have,quite a lot of experience,,In fact, he really,had more experience,at climbing on Mount Everest,than anyone else,,MAN: Without the Sherpas,you can't climb Everest,and my father was the head man,,People respected him,,They knew that he had been climbing,Everest with foreigners since 1935,,You know, he'd been up,six times already,,EDMUND HILLARY:,I knew Tenzing by repute,,You know, he'd done,a lot of mountaineering,and I knew he was,very highly regarded,,But I wasn't able really,to communicate well with him,,His English was very limited,and my Nepali was very limited,,He had a flashing smile,,absolutely charming smile,,It was impossible not to like him,,In the next fortnight,,we had a period of training,and testing ourselves,and our equipment at altitudes,,MAN: Well, in 1953,,getting to the summit of Everest,in terms of physiologic capability,was a big unknown,,It was like sending,somebody into space,,They knew from altitude,experiments in chambers,that altitude can make you seize,and one of the ideas was that people,would haemorrhage in their brains,because their blood vessels,would be so dilated,,There were lots of reasons to think,that there might be a stroke,,Nobody knew whether or not,it could really be done,,MAN: When Ed was heading,up the mountain in 1953,,13 people had already,died on the mountain,and I think that for anyone,who would be climbing at that time,it would be something,of a daunting statistic -,13 deaths and zero summits,at that point,,HUNT: Now, about,six miles up from Tengboche,looking north is the Khumbu Glacier,where we were to place,our main base camp,for the attack on the mountain,,This icefall was to be,our next great obstacle,and I sent a party to explore it,,Ed Hillary led this first party,,(EERIE MUSIC),EDMUND HILLARY: The Western Cwm,is guarded by a great icefall,,,,,,a tumbled mass of ice dropping,2,500 feet to the Khumbu Glacier,,We first had to discover whether it,was possible to ascend this icefall,,The icefall was a constant hazard,and we had no alternative,but to make a route through country,which we knew to be unjustifiable,in the ordinary alpine climb,,MAN: It's like a waterfall,that's come off and has frozen,,The weight of the glacier,above them is shoving,,It's all a jumble of ice,,It is unstable objective danger,that you have no control over,,Crazy! My God, You 're dumb,to be going up a route like that,,But you just can't go any other way,but through the icefall,,MAN 2: In '52, the Swiss,went up the icefall,and said, ""It's a thing,that's always on the move,"",And it's a dangerous place,for that reason,,More people are killed in the icefall,than anywhere else on Everest,,(CREAKING AND CRACKING),It's immense,,It's 2,500 feet high,,And we had to go,up the middle of it,,MAN 2: Ed Hillary, George Lowe,,Mike Westmacott and myself,were the four of us chosen,to make the first route through,in a week or five days if we could,,,,,,and then of course to make it safe,by a lot of step-cutting,,a lot of fixed ropes,so that eventually,it would be possible,for loaded porters to carry,the stores safely through it,,(TENSE MUSIC),WESTMACOTT:,The icefall was a dangerous place,because things did collapse,without warning,and if you were in the way,,it was a thoroughly bad thing,,(CRACKING),BAND: You had,these great towers of ice,and great lumps and strips,the size of a row of cottages,that could slump down at any moment,,We gave names,to the more dangerous parts,,There was Mike's Horror,,Hillary's Horror,,an area called the Nutcracker,,the Atom Bomb area,,WESTMACOTT: There are certain,,,,,,what climbers call objective dangers,which basically,you can't do much about,,There's also a risk,of falling into a crevasse,,BAND: We had these light,aluminium ladders about six feet long,which we could bolt together,across the crevasses,,And there were so many crevasses,that we soon ran out,of all the ladders we had,,So we had to send down,to where the nearest trees grew,,which would be about,three days' walk away,,to cut small tree trunks,to make little log bridges,,(WOOD CREAKS),And you balanced,as well as you could,,For us, it was clearly going to be,the only way to climb Everest,,CONEFRE Y:,Ed Hillary wanted to please,,He wanted to be on the summit team,,He would've known,that only a few people,would get a chance,to go for the summit,so from very early on,he wanted to impress John Hunt,and he felt there,was time pressure on him,to recce the icefall,to get it prepared,,PETER HILLARY: My father,was never afraid of hard work,,but part of that was to cover,I think what Dad felt,were a lot of psychological,or emotional inadequacies,,He had been raised,with high expectations,and they sent him off,to Auckland Grammar School,two years too young,,EDMUND HILLARY:,I was only 11 years old,and I was rather terrified, really,,When lunchtime came,,I would go out,the back of the school,and there were a whole lot,of ants living there,,When I first went,to Auckland Grammar,,the only friends I really had,were the ants,,I was a dreamer,until I started climbing,,HUNT: The icefall was really chaotic,and yet they forced a way,and Ed's job of route finding,was a particularly good show,,BAND: The New Zealanders,had a lot more snow,and ice climbing experience,than the average European climber,because their mountains are,very like the Himalayas in miniature,,(SOARING MUSIC ON NEWSREEL),NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:,The Southern Alps -,the great mountain tangle,which sprawls northw ards,in an almost unbroken chain,of rock and ice.,INTERVIEWER: Well, Ed,,how do the Southern Alps,compare with the Swiss Alps?,That's where the English climbers,get their training.,EDMUND HILLARY: Here in New,Z ealand, with our terrific glaciation,,a greater amount of our climbing,is done on snow and ice -,in many w ays very similar,to the Himalay a.,They're rather different,from the Swiss Alps,where the predominant feature,for climbing is rock.,NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER: Mount,Aspiring, New Z ealand's Matterhorn -,a shark's tooth of a mountain,whose dangerous slopes,demand skill and careful climbing.,EDMUND HILLARY:,Our New Z ealand mountains,are really a wonderful,training ground for the Himalay a.,VENABLES: Kiwis,have that tough resilience,so I think that,the younger British climbers,were somewhat in awe,of these formidable Kiwis,brought in to reinforce the team,,HUNT: Now, the next big doubt,was regarding the lip,of the coomb itself,at the very top of the icefall,,You see, there was,an enormous, gaping crevasse,,Could we get into the coomb?,PETER HILLARY: The decision,on who would be going,all the way to the top,was very much,the leader's prerogative,,John Hunt would evaluate the team,throughout the course,of the expedition,,So there was a fair amount of,sort of posturing,and positioning going on,as people tried to put,themselves in the best light,for that sort of opportunity,,BAND: I think,amongst the British,there wasn't any particular,jockeying for position,,but I think our two New Zealanders,,Hillary and Lowe,,were perhaps rather,more straightforward,in wanting to get,as high as possible,,They were the sort of colonials,that would make good,and we were perhaps,a little bit more inhibited -,the public school type that,wouldn't push our way forward,unless Hunt had said,,""Look, you 're the chap to do it,"",EDMUND HILLARY: I'd always hoped,that George Lowe and I,would be the final summit pair,,but there was no time,that John Hunt, our leader,,wanted to have two New Zealanders,stand on top of Mount Everest,,So I had to look around,and find someone,who was as fit as I was,and who could do a good job,,Tenzing was that person,,MAN: Nobody alive had more,experience of Everest,,He really understood the value of it,and how it could change his life,,Tenzing had been very, very poor,,He had struggled,,He wanted his children,to go to good schools,,He wanted more for them,than he'd had,,Tenzing understood,what climbing Everest meant,,My father was a bit of an anomaly,as far as a Sherpa goes,because he always,wanted to climb Everest,,That's very unusual,for a poor kid from Tibet,,So unlike many other Sherpas who,actually climb just to make a living,,he was a mountaineer at heart,,His drive was to go to the top,just like Ed Hillary,,HUNT: As we walked on into,the coomb, the crevasses grew fewer,and we realised that,the coomb itself was open to us,,(DRAMATIC MUSIC),HUNT: We are now,established at Base Camp,and the first problem,is to get our supplies,up to Camp 4 high up,in the Western Cwm,,Owing to the climbing,difficulties in the icefall,,laden porters require,three days to reach Camp 4,,CONEFRE Y: There was,this idea in those days,of laying siege to a mountain,,This meant you would do it,in a very systematic way -,you would set up a camp,and you would set up another camp,and get higher and higher,,VENABLES: You build up,this pyramid of camps,to get enough tents, food,,cooking fuel, oxygen -,to get enough of those supplies,where you can rest,before going up to the next stage,,And to do that, people have,got to go up and down the mountain,,Ideally, people go up to a camp,and then go back down again,'cause if everyone goes up to a camp,and then stays there,they then consume,all the food they've carried up,,CONEFRE Y: People tried,to come up with solutions,which would help the team,to get to the top,,people from around the world,sending in madcap,suggestions on inventions,,Somebody had an ingenious device,which was a type of harpoon,with an incendiary device,on the end of it,,The idea was that it would,burn its way into the ice,and give a secure holding,so people could haul themselves up,,Most of them were,completely crazy ideas,,VOICEOVER: My method,involves the use of a hand cable,laid in adv ance by aircraft...,VOICEOVER 2: With my relay w armth,personal heating apparatus,,air could be passed through,a heating chamber,and pumped via rubber tube,to the hands, feet and head...,VOICEOVER 3:,May I mention a Wonder Gun,for driving steel bolts,into concrete...,VOICEOVER 4: I suggest,that a woollen suit,be wired in much the same w ay,as an electric blanket...,VOICEOVER 5: It should be possible,to ascend the mountain,using a large helium-filled balloon.,A significant amount of helium,would be required.,MAN: Nearly all,of the technological innovations,that were used on the 1953 expedition,arose from things,developed by the military,during the Second World War,,They tested the windproof equipment,they were going to be wearing,in the wind tunnel,at Farnborough Aircraft Factory,,30 different firms, UK firms,,were involved,in designing the boots alone,,The ascent of Everest in '53 had,become a question of national pride,,When World War II ended,,Britain was completely bankrupt,and because of the austerity,,the postwar austerity in Britain,,the really awful days,that had past,,,,,,it was the last,great colonial project,,the last hurrah,of the British Empire,,PETER HILLARY:,My father and Tenzing,kept volunteering to help,in different situations,to demonstrate their competency,as being one of the summit teams,,Dad could see that there were,a whole lot of reasons,why this could be,a great combination for success,,They were very at home,in this alpine environment,,They were hungry,,They wanted the top,,CONEFRE Y: There's a point,where they were partnered together,and they were racing down,the Khumbu Icefall,,trying to prove that,they could do it quickly,,But as a sort of product,of his over-exuberance, really,,he's racing through it,and something goes wrong,,EDMUND HILLARY: Tenzing and I,headed back down to Base Camp,,When we were about,halfway down the icefall,we came to one of the crevasses,,On one side of it,there was a great chunk of ice,and we had used this,as a stepping stone,to reach the other side,,(TENSE MUSIC),CONEFRE Y: It was slightly ironic,that it was Ed Hillary,,who was such a good climber,,that it should happen to him,,EDMUND HILLARY:,People have often said to me,,""You must've been very thankful,,""Tenzing having saved,your life like that,"",but I don't think I was,,You know, I'd have been very annoyed,if he hadn't saved my life,,HUNT: Camp 4,has now been established,and we have successfully carried,the three tons of supplies up here,,VENABLES: You don't,conquer a mountain,,If you 're lucky enough,,the mountain gives you a chance,to stand on the top,,You 're trying to overcome,your own weaknesses,,CONEFRE Y: Ed Hillary,,he was so kind of gung-ho,and he always,wanted to be out front,,he always wanted to be in the lead,,He wasn't brash, He was a quieter,,sort of more reserved, character,,PETER HILLARY: Dad was,quite a complicated person,,I think my father,had quite a few demons,born out of being a perfectionist,,but also the sense of inferiority -,nothing is ever quite good enough,,I think it came out of a very,complicated family background,,EDMUND HILLARY: My father,really wasn't very interested,in adventurous activities,,He was a man of very strong beliefs,,The climbing of mountains he probably,regarded as a bit of a waste of time,,I fought with my father,,And I would usually end up,being taken over to the woodshed,and being given a good thumping,,I'm rather proud of the fact,that I never actually,admitted I was wrong,,,,,,even if I had been,,(TYPEWRITER CLICKS),(DING!),WESTMACOTT: Well, of course it was,of tremendous interest to all of us,who would be chosen,for the final push,,VENABLES: In those days,,the leader's word was absolute,,,,,,particularly for men who had,all been in the armed forces,,Hunt had to make the decision,,He would say who were,going to be the lucky ones,who were going to have,a crack at the summit,,It was at our Base Camp,and John Hunt got everybody round,and outlined his plans,for the rest of the expedition,,The crucial thing, of course,,was the attempts for the summit,,VENABLES: At that meeting,,that extraordinary,meeting with this team,totally isolated,from the rest of the world,,thousands of miles from home,,,,,,those men, each thinking,,""Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful,""if I was one of the lucky ones,"",BAND: You 're all chosen,as basic climbers to go to the top,,but there are all these,other jobs to be done as well,,PETER HILLARY: My father,was absolutely determined,that he was going to have an opportunity,to climb this mountain,,NORBU TENZING:,One of the conditions,for my father to go,with the English team,was that he'd have a chance,to go to the top,,There was no other climber,quite as accomplished,,WESTMACOTT: All of us would have,liked to have a crack at the top,,but the first attempt on the summit,was to be made by,Tom Bourdillon with Charles Evans,,,,,,and, ""If needed,,the second attempt,"" he said,,""is going to be made,by Ed Hillary and Tenzing,"",PETER HILLARY: I'm sure my father,would have loved to have,been in the first team,,Tenzing was probably,quite conflicted by it,,HUNT: The next stage,,and the really crucial one,,is up the Lhotse Face,to the South Col,,VENABLES: John Hunt said, ""OK,,Tom Bourdillon with Charles Evans,,""We'll send the two,of them up first,,""They can do a huge leap,from the South Col,""right to the summit in a day,"",HUNT: The first major task,in this plan fell to George Lowe,,He was to make a route up,the Lhotse Face and prepare the way,for the high-carrying parties,to reach the col,,This was to be finished by 15 May,,CONEFRE Y:,Basically what he said was,,""We want to be in a position,to climb Everest on May 15,"",because there was a constant fear,in the back of Hunt's mind that,“The monsoon would come,and end all our hopes,"",But they had to get up this thing,called the Lhotse Face,,EDMUND HILLARY: This is a vast,4,000-foot snow-and-ice face,leading up steeply,to the South Col at 26,000 feet,,(WIND HOWLS),George Lowe, my fellow New Zealander,,spent much time and energy,bashing a route,up this difficult problem,,LOWE: Well, the work on,the face was very difficult,and made more difficult,and atrocious,by the weather and daily falls,of snow which covered the tracks,,I shared my high perch,for a long time with Ang Nyima,,a splendid little Sherpa,,WESTMACOTT: George Lowe,worked on the Lhotse Face,without oxygen for over a week,up to about 24,500 feet,,LOWE: The cold was terrific,and the wind was bad,and all the time I was hoping,to get the traverse complete,and the route right through,to the South Col,,But I was thrashed by the weather,and the altitude was affecting me,,We didn't seem to be able to make,the last 1,000 feet to the col,,CONEFRE Y: John Hunt's big mistake,was that he underestimated,the Lhotse Face,,It's just so big,,He didn't give enough,support to George Lowe,,LOWE: It really was,myself and Ang Nyima,,Whenever they did send up support,,within 24 hours, they were,not able to carry on,,HACKETT:,Being at high altitude,,you never feel very well,,Each breath of air,we take in at high altitude,has fewer oxygen molecules,so we need more breaths in order,to get the same amount of oxygen,,WHITTAKER: Put a pillow,over your mouth,and try and breath through it,as you 're running,,(PUFFS) You just suck in air,,you 're trying to get enough air,and the oxygen debt builds up,until you just can't go any,,,,You have to stop, (PUFFS HEAVILY),Take three, four breaths to a step,,five breaths to a step,,six breaths to a step,,15 breaths to a step,,You 're just not getting the air,,(WIND HOWLS),LOWE: Up there, your mind,somehow gradually accepts slowness,,I thought I was going,extremely well,,but in fact we were staggering about,like men in a dream,,HUNT: We had spent,10 days on the Lhotse Face -,considerably more,than I'd reckoned on -,but we had still not broken through,to the South Col,,The time factor,was becoming critical,,BAND: Watching the progress,on the Lhotse Face,,there was no doubt that,the momentum of the attack,seemed to be winding down,,and the first inklings of the monsoon,were building up,in the Bay of Bengal,,VENABLES: It was,a very, very critical time,,You could imagine Hunt,feeling that this whole great enterprise,was just unravelling,and, ""If we don't get,a grip on this thing soon,""we're going to lose our chance,,""The monsoon will arrive,""and we won't even have reached,the South Col, let alone the summit,"",(MORSE CODE BEEPS),MAN: This is London calling,the British Mount Everest expedition.,Here is the latest weather bulletin.,Western disturbance,apparently moving eastw ards,across the extreme north of Nepal,is likely to cause,cloudy to overcast skies,with occasional thunderstorms...,CONEFRE Y: The later in May it was,,the more likely,that the monsoon would arrive,,When the monsoon comes,,you get huge dumps of snow and they,make climbing much more difficult,,You don't want to be climbing through,large amounts of soft snow,,wading your way through it,,The British expeditions,of the 1930s had all failed,because the monsoon had come early,,And so all of this was,piling on the pressure, you know?,BAND: So even though the route,hadn't actually been made,all the way to the South Col,John Hunt had to make,a sort of crucial decision,to start sending up,the team of 14 Sherpas,to carry all the stores we needed,,HUNT: Nothing must endanger,the getting of our stores to the col,in time for our,attempts on the summit,,EDMUND HILLARY: On 21 May,,Tenzing and myself,led a band of 14 high-altitude Sherpas,up the Lhotse Face,,(DRAMATIC MUSIC),13 Sherpas struggled up to,the col that day, without oxygen,,The 14th only just failed to make it,,and his load was carried on,,We were proud of them, and grateful,,It was a 10,5-hour day,,They carried 30 pounds each,,and their only nourishment,was a single cup of tea apiece,for breakfast,,BAND: And so we were able,to equip the camp properly,with tents, sleeping bags,,oxygen equipment and food,,and that was one of,the biggest achievements,,EDMUND HILLARY:,The South Col is probably,the most barren spot in the world,,The continual strong wind,is always blowing over,the dreary waste of rock and ice,,Adding an air of desolation,are the remnants of the Swiss tents,of the previous year,,with pieces of tattered cloth,still clinging to them,,NORBU TENZING: 1952, the Swiss,had invited my father to climb Everest,,and he had been up,where no human had been before,,but bad weather turned them back,,LOWE: I remember André Roch,,of the Swiss party, said,,""On the col,there's a smell of death,"",We thought that was,Continental dramatics,,but when we'd been there,,we understood,,WHITTAKER: I'm telling you, the cold,,you can feel it,coming up the extremities,,You know you 're gonna freeze,your hands and toes,,and you just feel the cold,creeping up,,It's a race between the body,and what you hope you can do,,You know that you 're dying,a little bit up there,,(WIND WHISTLES RELENTLESSLY),EDMUND HILLARY: A major step,had been achieved,,and we then returned,once more to the Western Cwm,,Without wasting any time,,we brought into action our assault plan,,CONEFRE Y: Hunt wanted to have,two attempts on the summit,,but he realised,that he couldn't have two attempts,which were using,open-circuit oxygen sets,,WESTMACOTT: In the open-circuit,,when you breathe out, the,expired air goes to the atmosphere,,and when you breathe in,,the atmospheric air comes with,an addition of a puff of oxygen,from your oxygen set,,CONEFRE Y: The thing about,open-circuit oxygen sets,is that they use a lot of oxygen,,so he would have to get,an awful lot of oxygen,up onto the South Col,and to the Southeast Ridge,,so he sort of thought,,""Well, no, we're not gonna,be able to do this,"",But there was an alternative form,of oxygen set,,which was called a closed circuit,,WESTMACOTT: The closed-circuit,,when you breathe out,the carbon dioxide,goes through a canister,of something called soda lime,,which extracts the carbon dioxide,and gives you back the oxygen,into the set,,and you 're completely insulated,from the outside air,,Now, if it works, the closed system,can be more efficient,than the open-circuit system,,CONEFRE Y: The people who are using,the closed-circuit set,can start from lower down,,But the thing about,a closed-circuit set,was that the only person,who really knew how to use them,was the person who had,designed them, Tom Bourdillon,,WESTMACOTT:,And the first attempt on the summit,,using the closed-circuit oxygen,,was to be made by Tom Bourdillon,with Charles Evans,,John Hunt went ahead,to the South Col in support,,PETER HILLARY: Evans and Bourdillon,left Advanced Base,down in the Western Cwm,and climbed up the South Col,to camp,,WESTMACOTT: Tom and Charles,were to go all the way,from the South Col to the top,,I thought at the time,they had a chance,,but it was a hell of a long way,,PETER HILLARY: If Bourdillon,and Evans reach the summit,,John Hunt might go, ""Job done,,""We're all going home,,Everyone's safe,"",But the weather closed in and,everyone got stuck for two days,,including Bourdillon and Evans,on the South Col,,My father and Tenzing,left Advanced Base,down on the Western Cwm,to come up to the South Col,to be the second summit team,,EDMUND HILLARY: Well, we left,Base Camp in the Western Cwm,,There was our support party -,George Lowe, Alf Gregory,and several Sherpas,,And then Tenzing and myself,,who were the actual assault party,,with the open-circuit,,PETER HILLARY: As my father and,Tenzing were departing from Camp 4,,Bourdillon and Evans were,making their summit bid,,EDMUND HILLARY: Well,,we went up the Lhotse Face,and across the long traverse,that leads up to the South Col,,And we're just about,up to the South Col,when we notice the support party,,George started shouting,and jumping around,,And we looked up,and we saw Evans and Bourdillon,going up the tiny little peak,far above us,,onto the top of the South Summit,,I think it was somewhere,around about 12:00 in the morning,,and we thought, ""Ooh, they've,,,,South Summit, 12:00,,""They've time to get to the top,,""They're going to climb it,"",PETER HILLARY: You know, when,Bourdillon and Evans went out of sight,,there would've been,very high emotions,,because these guys wanted,to be up there,,EDMUND HILLARY: We crossed over,and reached the South Col,,A little later in the day,,we kept an eye out,for the clouds that,come over the mountain,,and we were a bit worried,about Evans and Bourdillon,,But, uh, I think,it was about 3:30,,George once again,caught sight of them,coming down the couloir,from the Southeast Ridge,,down towards the South Col,,LOWE: And it was a long time,before they actually started,to come down,,And when they were coming down,,they were clearly very, very tired,,PETER HILLARY: When Bourdillon,and Evans came down,,Dad walked out to meet them,,People tend to see it in terms of,this really good guy going out,to meet them and help them back,,and there was that, absolutely,,But there was another part,,which was inside, where he,,,,,,he wanted to climb this mountain,,He needed to know,,""Where did they get to?"",EDMUND HILLARY: And they told us,that they'd reached,the South Summit alright,,had a look at the summit ridge,,but hadn't had sufficient time or oxygen,or energy to go any further,,CONEFRE Y:,They were in a terrible state,,Most of the day Charles Evans,had been climbing with an oxygen set,which didn't work properly,,so he'd been inhaling,carbon dioxide as well as oxygen,,But I think also Tom Bourdillon was,very,,,emotionally in a bad state,,because it really meant,a lot to him, you know,,He had designed this oxygen set,which had failed,,So they were in a bad way,,physically and emotionally as well,,GREGORY: Tom Bourdillon kept saying,,""We should've had a go,,""We should've gone on,"",you know,,""We should've gone on,"",VENABLES:,Evans and Bourdillon,were very strong,,very experienced climbers,,Having climbed higher than any,human beings had ever been before,,,,,,having got to the South Summit,and looked across at this final,,almost knife-edged ridge,,Charles Evans did say to Ed Hillary,something like,,""That last ridge looks really hard,,I don't know if you can do it,"",(WIND RUSHES),HACKETT: Above 26,000 feet,is what we call the death zone,,because you are slowly dying,,It's not a place for humans,,GREGORY: John Hunt was a leader,leading from the front,,And as the front now,was up above the South Col,,that's why he wanted to stay,,and we realised that he really,wasn't strong enough to stay,,VENABLES:,It was a classic case,of someone having been,too high too long,,GREGORY: He'd gone beyond the limit,,like Tom Bourdillon,and Charles Evans,,And he was eventually persuaded,to go down with them,,They were exhausted,and we were worried about them,and we dug out some oxygen,to help them,,HUNT: Well, I hated,to leave the col,,but after a certain amount,of discussion,,I saw that I could not weaken,the second party,,So I left Ed with the parting,instruction not to give in,,CONEFRE Y: This was a great moment,on the expedition,in which the leader sacrifices,his own personal ambition,,and Ed Hillary says,,""Never at any moment,""have I respected John Hunt more,"",LOWE: You know,,it was touch and go,,because the monsoon comes,in the first week of June,,and it was tight,,on the last days of May,,(WIND RUSHES),CONEFRE Y: For Hillary and Tenzing,to make an attempt on the summit,,they couldn't go from the South Col,,because they would have to carry,too much oxygen,,So the only way was to start from,higher up, then go for the summit,,(WIND RUSHES),EDMUND HILLARY: The following day,was extremely windy and cold,,and no movement upwards,was possible,,We spent the day preparing,the oxygen and gear,,with the hope that the following day,would prove clear and fine,,CONEFRE Y: They would use oxygen,at night, flowing at a very low rate,,because it would help them sleep,and make them feel,slightly warmer as well,,WHITTAKER:,Night-time is a tough time,,You lay there,listening to the mountain,,,,,,listening to the wind,,listening to the avalanche,,Thinking, ""Oh, my God,"" you know,,Demons come,,LOWE: The original plan was,that Gregory and three Sherpas,would carry the high camp,,One Sherpa had collapsed on the col,and gone down previously,,leaving us two Sherpas,,On the morning of the day,we intended to do the carry,,we poked our head,into the pyramid tent,and found Sherpa Pemba,in a very bad condition,,It was obvious,that he wouldn't carry,,and so we had the job,of sharing the load,,GREGORY: First of all,,early in the day,we knew that we'd have to reorganise,the loads and take more,,George Lowe and I and Ang Nyima,left about a quarter to nine,,LOWE: Ed and Tenzing left,the South Col an hour behind us,to conserve their energy,and to go faster through our steps,and so conserve their oxygen,,And we took off carrying,between 50 and 60 pounds,,and Ed, I think we estimated his,at 63 pounds,,which is quite an enormous load,for that altitude,,The wind was very strong,on the col,,We had very difficult conditions,,We moved up this ridge,looking for a flat spot,,GREGORY: For a long time,we couldn't find a camp site,,,,,,until at last Tenzing found one,,a nearly flat spot,underneath a rocky bluff,,EDMUND HILLARY: They helped us,to the highest camp,ever put up on Everest,or any other mountain,,at 27,900 feet,,VENABLES: No-one had ever camped,this high before,,George Lowe and Alf Gregory,take a few pictures,and then shake hands and say,,""Well, 'bye now, Good luck,,""We'd better be off down,"",And then there's,a wonderfully poignant moment,,PETER HILLARY: Ang Nyima,is very tired, he should go down,,But he said to Dad,that he wanted to stay,so he could make some tea when,they came down, and help them,,I know Dad was,very touched by that,,But eventually they start,back down again,,VENABLES: Leaving Hillary and Tenzing,completely alone,,EDMUND HILLARY: It was with,certain feelings of sorrow,that we saw George and Greg,and Sherpa Ang Nyima,descending down the mountain,,leaving us up there all alone,,We'd have much preferred to have,a bit of company for the night,,However, they had to get down -,our oxygen was running short,,PETER HILLARY: You 're totally,on your own, really out on a limb,,There's no radio contact,with anyone,,You could disappear,and everyone will just wonder,,""Whatever happened to them?"",I think it would've been,very exciting,,very Ionely and very scary,,(WIND WHISTLES AND HOWLS),EDMUND HILLARY: It took us two,hours of solid work to set up the tent,on two strips of ground,a yard wide and 10 feet long,,CONEFRE Y:,Towards the top of Everest,,you get these,very, very powerful winds,,and they were very precariously,attached to this slope,and all the time they're worried,they're gonna be,blown off the mountain,,DOUGLAS: When the wind,gets up in the evening,you 're in,quite a dangerous position,because you 're pinned,to the mountain,,The noise is really frightening,,(WIND HOWLS AND RUSHES,RELENTLESSLY),CONEFRE Y: That night was the coldest,ever recorded on the expedition,,HACKETT: It's such,a dehydrating environment,,and there's only one way,to make water,,and that is you have to melt,snow or ice,,You 're breathing eight times more,than you are at sea level,,You can lose more than a litre a day,just from the heavy breathing,at high altitude,,In addition, the air is so dry,that it sucks the moisture,right from your skin,,EDMUND HILLARY: I made myself,as comfortable as possible,,half sitting and half reclining,on the upper shelf,,It wasn't comfortable, but I could,at least brace my feet and shoulders,to help our meagre anchors,hold the tent in the gusts of wind,,VENABLES: High-altitude climbing,is all about being comfortable,in uncomfortable places,,He was very good at basic,day-to-day survival, as was Tenzing,,and I think that's where,they really scored,,EDMUND HILLARY: Early in the night,,the wind dropped,,We had some oxygen,,which we used for sleeping purposes,for about four hours,out of the 16 hours we spent there,,For the four hours, at least,,we did doze,,but as soon as the oxygen cut out,we'd immediately wake up,and start feeling cold,,CONEFRE Y: He's all the time thinking,,""I don't want to use,tomorrow's oxygen,"",There's just little things go wrong,,They've lugged up an enormous,black oxygen cylinder,which they planned to use,for sleeping oxygen,,But, unfortunately,,having lugged this bottle up,,they discovered that somebody has,gone back with the adaptor for it,,so the bottle is useless,,EDMUND HILLARY: Well,,I didn't have the complete conviction,that we were going to be,successful,,I was very aware of the fact,that very good expeditions,had attempted the mountain,and had got very high,but had not succeeded,,At 6:30am we started off,from our tent,,We wasted no time in preparing,the oxygen apparatus and equipment,,CONEFRE Y: It's all about oxygen,at this point,,Hillary is constantly,thinking about this,,""How much oxygen do I need?,""What should the flow rate,of the oxygen be?"" You know?,""If I have it flowing at,a higher rate, then I feel better,,""but I use up the bottle,more quickly,"",DOUGLAS: It's very, very cold,,They measure it at below -25,,And that kind of profound,,bone-chilling cold,is almost like an assault, you know?,It's just grim,,CONEFRE Y: The team physiologist had,said, ""When you get to high altitude,,""you 've got to climb,using your oxygen sets,""at a rate of four litres per minute,,""Anything less than that, you 're not,gonna get real benefit from it,"",EDMUND HILLARY: Our progress,at first was pretty steady,,However, we examined,the oxygen supplies,and found we couldn't go on,our estimated four litres a minute,and have a chance,of getting to the top,,Had to cut it down to three,,PETER HILLARY: A fairly simple,calculation about the oxygen flow rate,is unbelievably difficult up there,because you 've got an addled,,oxygen-deprived mind,,EDMUND HILLARY:,After going for some time,,we reached the bottom,of a 400-foot slope,which led up to the South Summit,,and this slope,was a tremendously steep one,,We felt that this snow,could easily avalanche,,DOUGLAS:,There was a bit of a crust,,so you 'd think you were,standing on firm ground,and then it would give way -,it would be powdery underneath,,So Hillary is anxious about that,,And also fear of avalanche,,And they have this exchange,,EDMUND HILLARY: I remember,turning to Tenzing and saying to him,,""Well, what do you think,about it, Tenzing?"",He said he didn't like it at all,,thought it was,decidedly dangerous,,Then I said,,""Well, what do you think?,""Do you think we should go on?"",And he said, ""Just as you like,"",We climbed up it with a good deal,of fear and trepidation,,I think this is the first time,I've ever had to make a decision,as to whether something,was justifiable or not,,decided it wasn't justifiable,,but we still went on,,DOUGLAS: You 're right on the edge,of what's possible,and every step you take is,putting you more into danger,,so the temptation to turn round,and go down is strong,,EDMUND HILLARY: I'm frightened,a great deal of the time,when I'm in dangerous country,,But I think being afraid,is one of the important factors,,It's a stimulating factor,,Of course, if you just get,petrified with fear,,then it would be hopeless,,PETER HILLARY: The crux of it is,whether or not you 're gonna survive,,You know,,none of that is guaranteed,,If anything goes wrong up there,,even a relatively minor accident,can very rapidly slide,into a fatal one,,EDMUND HILLARY: It was a great relief,when we reached,the South Summit at 9am,,Oxygen was running short,,so we wasted no time,and set off along the ridge,,But we were moving slowly,and time was against us,,PETER HILLARY: Evans and Bourdillon,had gone to the South Summit,and had had reservations,about the route ahead,,Evans had pointed out that there was,a very difficult knife-edged ridge,,It's serrated,,it's got these just horrifying drops,on both sides,,They must've had concerns about,whether or not they could climb it,,VENABLES:,On the left you 've got,the immense Southwest Face,of Everest,,and if you fell down that,,you 'd probably fall all the way,back down to the Western Cwm,,8,000 feet below,,And then to your right,is the even bigger precipice,of the Kangshung Face,,and that really concentrates,the mind,,EDMUND HILLARY:,For the mountaineer,,the thought of the process of dying,is more unpleasant,than the actual fact that,you may be dead at the end of it,,HUNT: In the meantime,,watching from below down at Camp 4,,we were all waiting most anxiously,,BAND: Obviously we'd hoped,to have our little walkie-talkies going,right up to at least the South Col,,but the one that was taken,to the South Col didn't work,,So in fact we realised,we wouldn't actually know,whether Hillary and Tenzing,had been successful,until they actually came down,and told us,,PETER HILLARY: No-one had any idea,where they were, how they were going,,would they be successful,,or, indeed, would they come back?,(SNOW CRUNCHES),EDMUND HILLARY:,Our oxygen equipment,was not all that sophisticated,,It only had a pressure gauge on it,,so I never really knew,just how much oxygen still remained,,My brain was working,fairly energetically,working out,just how much time we had left,,HACKETT: One of the problems,with extreme altitude climbing,is failure of oxygen systems,,And people die on a regular basis,when their oxygen packs up,,DOUGLAS: And then,there's a bit of a problem,,Tenzing is really struggling,,where before he was,following Hillary quite nicely,,EDMUND HILLARY: I suddenly noticed,that Tenzing seemed to be,in some distress,,And when I looked at him closely,,I saw that he was breathing,very quickly indeed,,I immediately examined,his oxygen set,and found that the outlet,from his oxygen mask,was almost completely,blocked up with ice,,Fortunately I was able,to release this ice,,DOUGLAS: Because,you 're suddenly hypoxic,and you 're not,thinking straight,,you may not immediately think,,""Oh, this is because my oxygen,equipment isn't working right,"",You just think, ""Oh, my God,,I'm incredibly tired all of a sudden,"",VENABLES: You have this strange,,slightly surreal blur,of images and thoughts and ideas,going through your head,,So you have to watch yourself,and watch each other very closely,,EDMUND HILLARY:,Well, after about an hour,we had made quite a distance,along the ridge,,and then we came to a rock bluff,which barred the way,along the ridge,,Now, I really thought that perhaps,this was as far as we were going,,I took photographs,because the actual rock itself,was very steep,and we knew that it could stop us,,PETER HILLARY:,Was that step even climbable?,And was it climbable,at 29,000 feet?,No-one had ever gone there before,,WHITTAKER: It's a hell of a step,,You look at that and you think,,""Oh, my God, What a decision,"",But Sir Ed took the gamble,and thought,,""What the hell,,I'm gonna go for it,"",EDMUND HILLARY: The only way,to climb it seemed to me a crack,where the ice was,sticking to the rock,,and I wasn't at all sure,that the ice would remain in place,when I was wriggling my way up,,I was scared stiff,,VENABLES: He just set forth,up this nearly vertical step,and wedged himself in this chimney,more or less with his feet,,his cramponed feet pressing,against the rocks on the left,and his back pushing out,against the snow on the right,,and just hoping,the snow wouldn't give way,and catapult him 11,000 feet,down the Kangshung Face,,Because it's doubtful whether,Norgay could've held him on the rope,if he'd come off,,(ROCKS TUMBLE),PETER HILLARY:,Little slabs were breaking off,and Dad was not really,enjoying the conditions,,You know, if he was back,in the Southern Alps,,he'd probably turn around,and try it another day,,And then, um, that little,internal voice going,,""Ed, my boy, this is Everest,,""You 've got to go,the extra distance,"",EDMUND HILLARY: By jamming back,on the ice with my crampons,,or ice spikes on my boots,,and scrambling on the rock in front,,I was able to wriggle and push my way,up the crack and onto the top,,After recovering my breath,,I took the rope in,and, with many a heave,,and old Tenzing wriggling,and scrambling the same,,got him onto the top,of the rock too,,VENABLES: There are times in life,,you know,,when you have to be,bold and decisive,,So much hung on Hillary's ability,to pull out all the stops,,and he was able to give it,that little extra,,CONEFRE Y: When Hunt had to,go down from the South Col,he turned to Ed and he said,,""Look, you know,,this is our last chance,,""You 're carrying a lot,of people's hopes on your back,"",WESTMACOTT: What would we do,if they failed?,Because that was a feeling,,particularly in John Hunt's mind,,I don't think

The Makeover of Ashton Croyd (2023) - full transcript,"In this pseudo-documentary, the Berlin based photographer Lisa Jonrel follows the homeless street musician Ashton Croyd for 6 months to observe him transform into a star.","(gentle music),- [Helena] Some metro,systems have circle lines.,These lines used to intrigue me.,They go round and round and,round and lead you nowhere.,The longer you ride the,less sense it makes.,The moment you've done the,full circle and continue riding,there is cause for concern.,(gentle music),I've encountered circle,lines in two cities,in London and in Berlin.,I'll never put my foot,in neither of them again.,
,
,
,I met Ashton, Croyd,along both lines,with almost 20,years between them.,I'm here to tell his story.,(gentle music),You may think you've,heard it before,,but you haven't really,,not the true story.,Many of you will remember the,pictures of a man going under,,but that's not who he was, at,least not how I remember him.,(gentle music),And as he's not here to,tell the story himself,,I'll try my best.,You'll see some interviews,and clips from his last year,,but they've been,edited and censored,
,
,
,by the people,behind the project.,And believe me, there were,dark forces behind this,that don't want to,show their true faces.,It took quite a few legal,battles to come to this point,,but here I am now.,I found enough footage,and information,,and the more I've found,,the more I understand,where you'll find his soul.,(gentle music),It's in his music.,♪ When the city wakes ♪,♪ When the city wakes ♪,♪ It will see what,we've been through ♪,♪ When the morning breaks ♪,♪ If we've survived ♪,♪ When the city wakes ♪,- [Helena] Since I,was a little girl,,I've always wanted to be,an actress, to be in films,,to tell romantic,stories of love and hate,and of life and death.,And here I am, finally,doing my own film.,And even though it contains,all the ingredients,I could wish for, this is not,the kind of film I imagined.,(upbeat music),I expect no red carpet.,No applause from the audience,on the opening night,,like I dreamed of 20 years ago.,A dream that led me to London,to develop as an actress,at one of the world's,leading drama schools.,And it's there that,I met Ashton Croyd.,(upbeat music),♪ When the city wakes ♪,♪ When the city wakes ♪,♪ It will see what,we've been through ♪,♪ When the morning breaks ♪,♪ If we've survived ♪,♪ When the city wakes ♪,- [Helena] Well, Ashton,was not his real name,,but the class gave,up to pronounce,his original Scandinavian,name after a couple of months.,So he chose Ashton,Croyd as an alias.,(gentle music),The in London was a time,of Shakespeare and love,,fencing and passion and,drama on many levels.,I was taken off guard when he,fell madly in love with me.,(gentle music),We were rehearsing scenes from,the comedy ""Twelfth night."",He played the jester Feste,,and I played Olivia.,(gentle music),Officially I could not allow,myself to return his feelings.,I was engaged.,But in the rehearsal space,,I sometimes couldn't,restrain myself.,It was like living,in a different world,where they spoke a poetic,and romantic language,that seemed so much more,relevant to our feelings,than the language,we found outside.,(gentle music),Our backgrounds couldn't,be more different,,but here we could be equals.,We were both foreigners.,But as even the English students,struggled with Shakespeare,,we didn't feel out of place.,We fell in love while speaking,this long lost language,so much that the reality,outside started to blur out.,(soft music),The drama school was scattered,around southwest London,,so we were constantly,on the move underground.,The sound of the Tube became,the soundtrack of that time.,The screeching sound of,friction between metals,,the lights flashing by,in the dark tunnels,,then the complete,silence and the darkness,when the lights went off.,(upbeat music),When school was finished,,he took a detour,to follow me to Notting,Hill where I lived.,After saying goodbye there,,he would continue on the,circle line to his dodgy flat,and King's Cross,,as he told me later.,(soft music),London was the coolest city,in the world at the time.,And to us it was the,perfect location.,We were the center,of the action.,When we were together, I was,the leading lady of my life,and he was the,leading man of his.,(soft music),Our many goodbyes by the steps,in Notting Hill Tube Station,had so much suspense in them.,He wanted desperately,to be physical,,but I would coquettishly,keep him at an arm's length.,I could not allow,that in public.,And I knew it had to stop.,(gentle music),There was a life after this,,and I knew I had already,let it gone too far.,(crowd chattering),""Twelfth Night"" was the,last play we did together,as groups changed,for the next plays.,So did the locations,for the rehearsals.,It was a relief to me.,I had such bad conscience,towards my fiance.,Now I would have less,contact with Ashton.,I knew that if I spent more,time with him at this point,,there would be no going back.,And I could just imagine the,size of that scandal back home.,We said our final goodbyes,at the street corner,outside South,Kensington Tube Station.,♪ I live a note but don't know ♪,♪ What it's for ♪,♪ Just scribble something down ♪,♪ To make this matter more ♪,♪ But it won't change a thing ♪,♪ Its all the same ♪,♪ Once it could have mattered ♪,♪ But the moment never came ♪,♪ Should say hello,to something else ♪,- [Helena] And he,didn't follow me,with a train to,Notting Hill this time,he said that we would,never meet again.,It felt like he had,turned completely cold.,♪ Why are we still,worlds apart ♪,♪ Have I been a fool,just to trust in fate ♪,♪ Have I been a clown wasting,time to wait for you ♪,♪ Are we still worlds,apart tonight ♪,♪ When yours shine so bright ♪,- [Helena] I cried my heart,out after he had jumped,on the Piccadilly Line,train back to King's Cross.,If I could have seen,into the future then,I would've run after him,and never let him go.,♪ So I've cleared my,head my words are out ♪,♪ But you will never know,what this is all about ♪,♪ My words will,give no meaning ♪,♪ You'll see no sense ♪,♪ But it will work just fine ♪,♪ As proof of my pretense ♪,(upbeat music),- [Helena] So I moved,back to Germany,,settled with my,fiance, got married,and did what people,wanted me to do.,Did what I thought I had to do.,It was a failure.,I could never settle,into being the Hausfrau,that people wanted me to become.,I could not give him kids.,I hated keeping up,the appearances.,He could never understand,my fits of restlessness,,anger, bitterness.,♪ Who are we ♪,♪ Who are we now ♪,♪ Who are we now ♪,♪ Who we we ♪,♪ Who are we now ♪,♪ Who are we now ♪,- [Helena] The sad thing,is that it took me 18 years,to realize it.,(upbeat music),I had no contact with,Ashton in this period.,But a week after me,and my husband split,,he contacted me on Facebook,,said he was coming to Berlin,,if we could meet.,It was like God wanted to,give us a second chance.,(upbeat music),It was a shock to see him again.,I was so full of expectations,,having sent messages,back and forth.,The old feelings came,back this sensation,of being back in,this romantic film.,But when I opened the door and,saw him, I remember thinking,,""Oh no, it's too late."",It broke my heart.,(gentle music),But I had to take him in and,we had to explore the feelings,that never had been,allowed to be explored.,We had to become us.,(upbeat music),♪ Who are we ♪,♪ Who are we now ♪,♪ Who are we we now ♪,♪ Who are we ♪,♪ Who are we now ♪,♪ Who are we now ♪,- [Helena] I think,he knew deep down,where this was heading,,but we had to explore it.,Even though it would,end in tears again.,(gentle music),And it would.,(gentle music),I introduced him to,Lisa before we split.,She was an artist working,with photo concepts,and installations.,I'd been discovering,Ashton's music again,in the time we had together.,And I thought there was,something special in his songs.,It was still as pure,as back in London.,And I wanted to stay,in Berlin at least,to be artistically fruitful.,Lisa was not a close friend,,but she moved in the,same circles as me.,And at a dinner party, she had,been talking about a concept,that she was developing.,- I was invited to have an,exclusive photo exhibition,at the JRGallery in Berlin.,This would be my second one.,And they wanted me,back as my previous one,a few years earlier,,was a great success.,The working title,or my working title,was Impossible Changes.,I wanted to prove that change,is possible if you want it,,however difficult it seems.,It was a theme that I had,been working on for a while,,but I found it kind of difficult,to find the right angle,or the right focus on it,,because the images I already,had were a bit too general,and a bit of, yeah, all,over the place, you know.,- [Helena] Lisa had really,grown big in art circles,as she managed to reach,new and bigger audiences,to the galleries.,(soft music),She came across as down,to earth and modest,,but always managed to catch,the latest in pop culture.,And she was second to,none when it came to PR.,The critics actually,claimed her true art form,was exactly that.,Public Relations.,- [Lisa] He was a,really rough looking,,middle aged character.,And from his appearance,it looked like,he was living on the streets.,And I found it kind,of funny because,he had a black acoustic,guitar that he seemed,to be taking better,care of than himself.,And he wasn't,impressive in any way.,I mean, the bascas in,Berlin are of high standard,and often working professionals,that just need some,extra cash, you know.,But sometimes the moods that,he created made me stop.,It was like he,shared his whole life,with the busy,commuters passing by.,Somehow he could fill the,space with this human soul,and this guitar,and this big voice.,(footsteps thudding),♪ Feel the current,is getting stronger ♪,♪ I need to find,my way back again ♪,♪ No way to find the,light you search for ♪,♪ No use in waiting for,this feeling to fade ♪,♪ When your tear,touch the ground ♪,♪ We're gonna find,the way back again ♪,♪

thou,must untangle this, not I.,It is too hard a,knot for me to untie.,(soft music),- Say, I didn't recognize any,of the songs he performed.,So, I assumed that it was,his own material, you know.,I think it's a brave,choice if you want people,to like what you're doing.,But somehow he seemed misplaced.,(gentle music),In the beginning it was,just a passing thought.,But one day, when I,returned to my studio,,I started thinking, ""Why is,this person in this situation?,""Could he change,his life around?,""And what would this,change be like, you know?,""I mean, how far can that go?"",Yeah and that's it.,That's how my,exhibition took a turn,and became the makeover,of Ashton Croyd.,(gentle music),- [Helena] In nature there's,no blemish, but the mind,,none can be called,deformed but the unkind.,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Just lead me on ♪,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Just come what may ♪,♪ We'll deal with,it on our way ♪,♪ Just lead me on ♪,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Yeah, just lead me on ♪,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Just lead me ♪,♪ Let's just pretend ♪,♪ That there won't be,no end ♪,♪ Ooh ♪,♪ Just lead me on ♪,- I needed to move,forward with my project,and it was an exhibition,about our time.,So I had to move forward with,the platforms of our time.,Because the exhibition,should be the closing of it,and the presentation,would be done online,on all the social,media platforms.,We are making a documentary,and they are following,me through my project.,- [Ashton] Okay, so they,they're a part of the--,- They are part of--,- [Ashton] Part of it,- yeah, they are,just the people to--,- [Ashton] There's,nothing hidden.,- [Lisa] No.,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Yeah just lead me on ♪,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Just come what may ♪,♪ We'll deal with,it on our way ♪,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Yeah just lead me

Just lead me on ♪,♪ Lead me on ♪,♪ Just lead me on ♪,- [Helena] I think Ashton,thought the makeover,would be a biographical,photo exhibition about him,as a musician.,And that Lisa would let the,music play a vital part of it.,That one would give,attention to the other.,That the focus would be,on him as a performer.,- [Ashton] A makeover,,it's a silly concept.,Yeah, I know, everybody loves it,because it's very much,in the time, yeah.,Because people think that,,""Oh, I lose whatever kilos,or blah, blah blah, blah."",And then, ""Oh look, success."",This is pathetic,,we all know this.,But it's a symbol,that people, you know,,it is this dream of,something can happen.,My life can change,around completely.,I can become,something else, yeah.,It's all a scam, it's not true.,To me it's about the music.,That's what I live and breathe.,That's what I care about.,That's my life.,- [Helena] I tried to reach,Ashton in this period,,but I couldn't get,through to him.,He was completely cut off,from the outside world.,However, we could all follow,the project on social media.,I had a growing feeling that,he was doing it all for me,to win me back.,That he would stand,at my door again,having lived up to,his full potential,that we would have our third,chance to get things right.,- If you don't follow, you,know, these are cliches,,but you know this.,If you don't fit into this,,then you are nothing basically.,So it's not so much about,,""Oh, I didn't make it."",It's about, ""I don't,wanna be a part of it."",I don't wanna be a,part of it, yeah.,And then when you don't,wanna be a part of it,,you know, it's the,anarchist problem.,If you don't wanna be a part,of it, there's nothing for you.,You're fucked.,(soft music),Because you have to,settle for our rules.,We come to this world naked.,Have absolutely nothing.,We come to this world naked.,And then after say two decades,,some people get the,idea in their mind,that they know how,everything works.,""Oh, the reason why you're,here is because this and that.,""And you have to behave,like this and that."",Who the fuck gave,them these ideas?,And who are they to tell,me or you what to do?,You came to this world,screaming, naked.,For fuck sake.,- [Lisa] Ashton was in a,deep crisis when I met him.,(soft music),I was introduced to,him by Helena Von Hoff,who actually had been,dating him to that point.,I think she felt really,bad about the situation,as she was the reason,he was in Berlin.,I had contacted her,right before that,,because I wanted,tips on musicians,that were struggling in Berlin.,So she hoped that a,cooperation with me,would help him move on quicker.,- Can you explain to me why...,It's, you have it in religion,,you have it in society,,you have the...,Suddenly people,become judgemental.,Suddenly some people,,""I'm so clever,""that I can judge you."",Why?,You came to this world,screaming red, blue or whatever,in the face, having,absolutely nothing.,Let's face it.,It's a fucking disgrace.,(gentle music),(train engine revving),(gentle music),I want to be me.,Yeah, I want to be me,(sirens wailing),so badly.,(sirens wailing),(Ashton chuckles),- [Interviewer] A,little change happen?,(sirens wailing),- Well.. the change, it,sounds like a disease.,Yeah.,- [Interviewer] What,about the change of mind?,You can say, ""I change,my perspective."",- Well, I'm sitting,here with you.,So things are, something,is happening, isn't it?,I dunno what, and I'm not naive.,(Ashton chuckles),I don't think, you know,,things fall from the sky.,But what is there,to lose for me?,I'm so, here I am,talking to you.,All your silly questions.,(gentle music),- Being hungry, being,cold, being no...,Have no roof and stuff, and,being ignored from other people.,That's what I wanna change.,I don't know.,I have the feeling that it's,my responsibility to do that,because I see so many people,that ignore that situation,and I'm not able to ignore it.,So I think it's my,responsibility to show that.,(upbeat music),- This is what people,are so crazy about.,You need to talk,about your past, yeah.,Oh yeah, your past.,Where are you from?,When did it go wrong?,When?,Huh?,(car engine revving),I don't believe it.,I don't think it's interesting.,I think people are too,concerned with these things.,I think they're,completely obsessed,with the concept of where,they're from, where they belong.,You know, people,,the world goes mental,about this at the moment.,(upbeat music),It is important to tell,the story, isn't it?,How did you end up like this?,Where did you come from, huh?,- [Interviewer],You know the story,is always about having the,past and moving forward.,- Yeah, yeah, I know in,your book it is, isn't it?,In your book, yeah?,- [Interviewer] We,don't have a book.,- [Ashton] Oh, you,don't play okay.,- [Interviewer] We,don't have a book.,We just go by what you tell,us, you know what your--,(car engine revving),- And then it's freezing.,It's, what would you expect?,How would you feel?,- [Interviewer] Well, to,be honest, I'm pretty glad,that I have a home.,- Why aren't you at home?,Why aren't you warm in,your living room, huh?,The bedroom, wrapped,up in your duvet, huh?,Why are you here?,- [Lisa] Even though,we were spending,quite a lot of time together,,I had problems talking about,how he spends his nights.,He said that he had,his naps on benches,and that he had a station,that he uses as a base,and that is under construction.,And he was very, very proud.,He never talked about,himself as homeless.,(upbeat music),- Yeah, I mean, honestly,,there's one thing I regret,in regard to Lisa's exhibition.,I do regret that we didn't,manage to protect her better.,You know, I mean a lot of,crazy things were going on,long before we,even opened doors.,There was news about this,thing like going mad.,It was a wildfire.,♪ It's time flash,your white teeth ♪,♪ It's time to let them stare ♪,♪ God knows what's,lying underneath ♪,♪ This fabric just won't tear ♪,♪ What a glamorous sight ♪,♪ Breaking through the night ♪,♪ All you see is waving hands ♪,♪ In the light ♪,♪ But I can't give you,what you came for ♪,♪ Just have a look round

I'll be gone I'll,be gone I'll be gone ♪,- You know the fan group, the,hashtag, the charity thing.,There were songs streamed,all over the place, viral.,You know, millions of clicks.,Images, tweets.,Kind of the momentum,was incredible.,I decided to hire,a young film crew,to create some clips and,content to enable people,to follow her process.,And that slowly developed into,the idea of a documentary.,Same happened with,the music by the way.,The clips of Ashton Croyd's,performances became so popular.,It was natural to, you know,,to book him into a studio.,Have a backing band.,It must have been like,winning a lottery.,♪ Go where your,feet will take you ♪,♪ You know it's getting late ♪,♪ Become what they,will make you ♪,♪ Knock knock knock ♪,♪ Here comes your fate ♪,♪ What a

♪,♪ I will be gone ♪,♪ I will be gone ♪,- At first it's,important that the person,already has an aura, so,I can catch something.,And then I think,it's very important,to get in a relationship,with a person,that the person can trust me.,And yeah, the,important thing is that,the person doesn't,feel uncomfortable,or doesn't feel,naked in any way.,That he feels,occupied in my work,and that he feels good.,(upbeat music),(suspenseful music),- [Helena] So after a,month of charming him,and building up his trust,,Ashton signed a contract,with Lisa that gave,her the freedom,to follow him and take,photos as she pleased,for her exhibition.,(suspenseful music),In return the,gallery would finance,the recording of Ashton's music.,I guess we will,never know if he knew,what he was signing up for.,Or if he cared about,the consequences,as long as he would be able,to finish his musical project.,♪ This crossroad,wasn't on my map ♪,♪ So I suspected it,could be a trap ♪,♪ Made my choice ♪,♪ Couldn't tell ♪,♪ If it would lead to,heaven or to hell ♪,♪ Ooh I still remember ♪,♪ The songs in my head ♪,♪ When I walked the streets ♪,♪ Back then ♪,♪ Was it you was it,you all the time ♪,♪ Was it you was it,you all the time ♪,♪ Was it you ♪,(upbeat music),- When Lisa Jonrel became,kind of his manager,,Ashton Croyd grew a substantial,fan base, quite fast.,She basically used,him as a PR stunt,and people say that she,actually didn't want him,to get off the streets because,he was more easy to set.,(gentle music),- I remember a press,release was forwarded to me,about a photographer,who single-handedly,would fight homelessness,with a camera.,I laughed at it and thought,,""Oh no another idealist,posing as Mother Theresa."",Until I read who was behind it.,(soft music),Her first solo exhibition got,a ridiculous amount of press.,For a couple of weeks,,she was like a pop star,and no one seemed to,know what happened.,She was the new poster,girl for the art world,and what could then,be more provoking,than it all looking like she,was running a kind of charity.,She was that good a sales woman.,(soft music),Lisa's social media,campaigns had a broader range,than I think she intended.,What started as a PR,for a solo exhibition,gave birth to a local,popular cultural icon.,(soft music),First the photos.,And they worked,great on Instagram,and that's how his,career just exploded.,(soft music),But then very soon,it was also his story,that the fans were interested in,and they wanted to save this,poor man living on the streets.,(gentle music),I believe her,intentions probably were,to reach a more,intellectual art audience.,(gentle music),His fan base was,soon named Croydsberg,after the group's,origin in Kreuzberg.,They were mostly millennials,that was probably looking,for a just cause to fight for.,And in principle, what,could be more just,than fighting for the people,we see suffering every day.,(gentle music),[speaking in foreign language],- We are always told that,we are what we deserve.,But that's all a lie.,And we are here,to stop the lies.,We will not stop until,every person on the streets,has been given help.,Has been given a house, a,permanent room and self respect.,[speaking in foreign language],- Well actually from,my point of view,,Ashton Croyd isn't the first,one who needs to be saved.,He is a White male.,He comes from one of the,richest countries in the world,with a perfectly,well social system.,[speaking in foreign language],- Reporters has put my,life under scrutiny.,24/7.,I mean this has been hyped up,and I... bless them.,I adore the Croydsberg,,but they are at the moment,not exactly what I need.,Because I have to live,up to some sort of ideal,that I'm not comfortable with,or can't live with.,(gentle music),- They created the #makeroom.,And basically it was,about getting room,for everyone living,on the streets.,- I guess my only,real connection,might be that I'm walking,past homeless people,and people who are trying,and fighting for their lives,and basic needs every day,,that I'm walking,past them every day.,And if you live in a,big city like I do,,at some point you'll,start to unnotice it,and blend out the nasty,stuff from the ugly stuff.,'Cause you don't want to see it.,(gentle music),[speaking in foreiagn language],- I am not a good human being.,I am not a good human being.,I've hurt so many people.,(gentle music),[speaking in foreign language],(gentle music),[speaking in foreign language],(gentle music),(birds chirping),- The one thing I,cannot forgive myself,for is that..,I left a little girl behind.,- He really loved my mom.,You know, he really, really did.,(gentle music),I don't know, kind of in,a way I always forgave him,for leaving because he,made my mom so very happy.,And I just, I loved,seeing her with him,because she laughed at,all of the stupid jokes,,even when they weren't,funny, she laughed.,He had this childhood,and this background,that wasn't the easiest and,I just would always blame,it all on that.,And..,he just, he brought,out the best in her,and that's what I,loved about him.,(gentle music),And when she got really ill,,(gentle music),we both just decided to,cry all our tears out,and just we sat there in our,living room and just cried.,(gentle music),It's was so long.,(upbeat music),♪ Now everything's dark ♪,♪ And I know that that,is scary for you ♪,♪

way ♪,- When the funeral,came, I didn't have,and I didn't have any,tears left to cry.,So I was the one,comforting people and he...,That's why I'm not mad at him.,I just don't get it.,I mean, if you love a,person, how can you leave?,I just, I don't get it.,(gentle music),- And that's where it all,goes wrong in my head.,Time and time again.,(soft music),Everything looks bright.,(birds chirping),(soft music),- [Helena] I should have known,that he had lived a life too.,It had been almost,20 years after all.,But he never told me about this.,It was like my whole,world fell apart.,The makeover was,never to win me back.,It was for her.,I realized you don't get a,third chance in real life.,I'd become a sad,,conceited person.,(gentle music),[speaking in foreiagn language],- [Helena] When public opinions,started to go against Lisa,,she went on a crusade,to defend her actions.,As I was not able to,reach Ashton,for along period of time,,and as she would ignore,my calls and messages,,I went to the press,to express my concern.,I wasn't the only one.,[speaking in foreiagn language],- [Helena] The Croydsberg,movement was starting,to divide itself,into two fractions.,On one hand, there,were the people,who were completely,loyal to Lisa,and on the other, a growing,group of concerned activists,and social workers.,[speaking in foreign language],- Yeah people turned on Lisa,and it was really ugly to,follow the Croydsberg movement.,(gentle music),They started to follow,her, they threatened her.,She had to move her,flat, move all her stuff,out of the studio.,She had to stay low.,(soft music),- [Helena] The answer,to the question,of how he could survive on,the street for half a year,awaiting his music to,be released is simple.,The Berlin Press,called it der cocktail.,- I woke up one morning,and the first thing I saw,was a reporter asking me,,[Ashton, in German],And they want to know,who's supplying this.,24/7 they trace me because,they want to find out,where these drop off points are.,So I have to move,in mysterious ways,to get away from all these,people trying to find out,where the drop off points are.,- [Helena] The cocktail was a,mix of substances and drinks,to keep him at bay.,They fed it to him secretly,,nobody could trace it.,- I mean, how can anyone,sponsor a life on the street?,How's that even possible?,[speaking in foreign language],- [Helena] The,makeover as an idea,was starting to become a joke.,Lisa had gone into the,project wanting Ashton,to change from a homeless person,into a star in six months.,But everyone could see his,appearance deteriorating,day by day, giving,the opposite effect.,They got the timing wrong,,the momentum came too early.,The exhibition came too late.,(gentle music),- I wanted Ashton,to release his music,as a part of the project.,I knew that was,important to him.,However, I couldn't,do everything alone.,And the people I worked,with made the conclusion,that his music was a bit,wrong for the project.,It was not the sound,of Berlin in 2018.,And we needed the,sound of Berlin in 2018,to follow my photos.,And there were also reports,that he was very difficult,to work with, that the,producer was really,struggling with him.,- [Helena] The producer,wanted to use bits and pieces,of his melodies and mix,them on top of industrial,dance grooves to portray,the grit and gloominess,of Berlin's underworld.,Yet finally being given,time to record his music.,But the producer had,left the session.,He could not work,with neither Ashton,nor his music, he claimed.,He had canceled the,first day of recording,due to the smell.,A smell you can expect from,my man living on the street,for half a year.,He was forced to wash before,coming back the next day.,- [Lisa] Remember, this,was my project, not his.,People missed that point.,Yes, I understand that his,song and his personality,made people take,him to their hearts.,But none of that would,happen without me.,Now people want to,give him all the credit,and that is just wrong.,This is my concept,,my story, my creation.,- [Helena] But at the 11th,hour, Lisa and the gallery,got their act together and,a physical makeover started.,They got the inspiration,from the heyday of Hollywood,,rainbow diet pills.,The cocktail changed from,alcohol to amphetamines.,(upbeat music),♪ We're drifted with the wind ♪,♪ Got lost along the way ♪,♪ And when a storm came up ♪,♪ We knew we couldn't be saved ♪,♪ Cause we were chasing,different things ♪,♪ Like people do ♪,♪ And there was,no time to think ♪,♪ No time to act ♪,♪ No time for me and you ♪,♪ I stay alone just,to hurt myself ♪,♪ I stay alone because I care ♪,♪ I stay alone,because sometimes ♪,♪ I know our love,will reappear ♪,♪ And you'll be there ♪,♪ Yeah, you'll be there ♪,♪ Well, I

interview,,I was happy to do so.,Most of all to defend Lisa.,And I will defend the,right to express yourself,in any given situation.,You know, freedom of speech,is at the core of my work.,And I will not let,criticism or cynicism,rule me or compromise my work,and compromise the artist,I choose to display.,- [Helena] Come,away, come away death,and in sad cypress,,let me be laid.,Fly away, fly away breath.,I'm slain by a fair cruel maid.,My shroud of white,stuck all with yew,,O, prepare it!,My part of death, no one so true,did share it.,Not a flower, not a flower sweet,on my black coffin,let there be strown.,Not a friend, not a friend,greet my poor corpse, where,my bones shall be thrown.,A thousand thousand,sighs to save,,Lay me, O, where,sad true lover,never find my grave,,to weep there.,♪ Goodbye goodbye goodbye ♪,♪ Goodbye goodbye goodbye ♪,♪ This is goodbye ♪,♪ Goodbye goodbye goodbye ♪,♪ Goodbye goodbye goodbye ♪,♪ This is goodbye ♪,♪ Such a failure such a say ♪,♪ But there

wanted to,orchestrate his own exit.,What a coward act,in a way, you know,,leave everybody behind,just for a glimpse of fame.,- [Helena] He had only,a few days to record,the songs you've,heard in this film.,When Lisa and her people found,the development of the music,,not according to the artistic,vision of the project,,the session was cut short.,I came by on the last,day, he was alone,and in a good mood.,It seemed he was,in a good place.,Back in drama school,,Ashton had made some tunes,for the songs in,""Twelfth Night."",They didn't seem to be,something special at the time.,But now 20 years later,,hearing them again,,I realized that they had,been with me all along,as tunes from the past that,I couldn't quite place.,- [Radio Host] She's,back by popular demand.,Please give a big hand,to Helena von Hoff,doing her famous recital,from ""Twelfth Night."",- [Helena] O mistress mind,,where are you roaming?,O stay and hear!,Your true-love's coming,that can sing both high and low;,Trip no

since.,(soft music),We went to court to,stop Lisa spreading,more her of lies and,self-promotion in,her documentary.,There was only one way,to win that battle,,through his music.,That's where his soul was.,She stole his face, his tragedy,,his future and his fate.,But she did not steal his music,because it wasn't,the sound of 2018.,(gentle music),- The moment somebody,puts money on the table,,you have to deliver something.,Which may have made me do,things that I wouldn't have done,because I feel a,slight pressure.,Well the only change,for me is that people,have started treating,me differently.,Looking me into the eyes.,(gentle music),You treat me differently too.,I don't know, you have,to ask yourself, why.,(soft music),- [Helena] Some metro,systems have circle lines.,These

Swades (2004) - full transcript,"Set in modern day India, Swades is a film that tackles the issues that development throws up on a grass root level. It is to this India, which is colorful, heterogeneous and complex that Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan), a bright young scientist working as a project manager in NASA, returns to on a quest to find his childhood nanny. The film uses the contrast between the highly developed world of NASA, which has been at the forefront of advances in space research, and this world back home in India, which is at the crossroads of development. Mohan's simple quest becomes the journey that every one of us goes through in search of that metaphysical and elusive place called ""home"".","Do you want subtitles for any video?,-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-,Good afternoon and welcome to the,Phase ll Press Conference of the,upcoming mission for the,Global Precipitation Measurement.,To discuss the mission we have,with us John Stockton,GPM Project Formulation Manager,from NASA HQ.,Mohan Bhargav,Project Manager and Spacecraft,Mission Director from GODDARD.,- Over to you John.,- Thank you George.,The Office of Management and Budget,released the President's 2004,fiscal year budget plan in early February,flagging off the GPM Launch.,We have in the Formulation phase,of GPM taken steps to reduce risks,

Princess (2008) - full transcript,"A few years after their graduation from Princeton, Louis Baxter, who retired having sold his dot.com business, takes in college-buddy William, who desperately nears the end of his trust fund after several fully failed career-attempts. Louis takes William along to L.A.'s weirdest society event, the annual endangered animals benefit. This year, to raise more money she auctions a single dinner, which William bids his last capital on. He wins, according to Louis a shrewd business networking opportunity. But he's love-spelled by Ithaca, while she believes him to be the seeker, a long-awaited savior for the castle's most secret reality.","( birds chirping ),Do you want subtitles for any video?,-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-,Young man: WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS,TO BE SELF-EVIDENT...,BABIES CRY, THE SKY IS BLUE,,AND AT SOME POINT,IN HER LIFE,,EVERY GIRL HAS WANTED,TO BE A PRINCESS.,BUT I NEVER EXPECTED,MY JOURNEY,TO TAKE ME ON THE ROAD,TO ITHACA.,( doorbell rings ),HEY!,THERE HE IS, KING,OF THE COUCH TOURS!,

,The Columbia is back after,spending seven days in space.,The movie has plenty,of ice, blood.,And things that go,bump in the night.,We'll also be reviewing,two eagerly awaited films,from producer Steven Spielberg.,Americans popped in,between $5 and $9 billion,worth of quarters.,""E.T."" is heavy,in visual effects.,It's set for,release on June 4th.,I can't think of a,year during my life,that the lineup was equivalent,as far as depth of storytelling,,epicness, significant,storytelling.,I've... seen things you,people wouldn't believe.,They liked to think,back in the '80s.,
,
,
,All those... moments,will be lost... in time.,There's still a little,hangover from the '70s,,And the '70s was, I,think, a golden age.,That was a time that,just blew everything up,,and so we were kind of,reaping the rewards.,Coming out of the '70s,,there was more of a sense,of character, the,antihero and the everyman.,Then all of a sudden we're,going to take that language,and put it into genre.,In the '70s, you had ""Jaws."",Biggest summer blockbuster ever.,Why, you son of a...,Followed up two years,later by ""Star Wars,"",which changed the world.,That was, I think, where so,many of us got hooked on movies,,when Spielberg and Lucas,changed everything.,After 1977, it was game over.,""Star,Wars""... It is more,than just a successful movie.,It is a box office phenomenon.,The film is breaking attendance,records all over the country.,Not since ""Jaws"",have so many people,stood in line to see a movie.,""Star Wars"" was a gateway.,We were hooked on sci-fi.,That's what we talked about,when we went to school.,Box office was,very much dominated,by high concept ideas.,Then in the wake of ""Star Wars,"",you had ""Superman,"" the movie.,You had ""Alien."" You,had other indie films,like ""Dawn of the Dead"",and ""Phantasm, ""Halloween,"",and all of the studios,are trying to figure out,how can we duplicate,both the indie success,and the studio success,of these one-off movies?,We were doing very well,in the '60s and '70s.,But when ""Star Wars"" came out,,I thought, the major studios,have figured out,what we've been doing,on a low budget, and,they're taking these ideas,,and we are going,to be in trouble.,'Cause they saw that,stories of the fantastic,had a really wide appeal,and not just for a,teenage audience.,So they started making,studio-level genre films.,People were,starting to feel,they could do,something interesting,in a blockbuster template.,The idea that you could,make movies as varied,as ""Poltergeist,"",""E.T.,"" and Blade Runner,,it's kind of a maturing of,the summer blockbuster...,It's too bad she won't live.,But then again, who does?,A lot of which is,science fiction.,People want to see,science fiction,,and so we gotta give that,to them, and I think '82 is,the year mass market science,fiction blockbusters...,That's the year their,voice broke, if you will.,You could certainly argue,there were better years,for cinema than 1982,,but there's no greater,geek year than 1982.,There are a lot of,great years for movies.,You could look at 1939,with ""Wizard of Oz"",and ""Mr. Smith Goes,to Washington."",So many people look at 1977 as,the greatest geek year ever.,But really, when it,comes down to it,,1982 is the greatest year,ever for movies, period.,Week after week, you have one,classic movie after another,that holds up 40 years later.,The reason 1982,was such a unique year,,it was a turning point,in a lot of ways.,It was this great moment,where, for whatever reason,,nerds accidentally won.,It was just a great,time to be a kid growing up.,I think our imaginations,were running wild.,We loved these adventures.,They were all,pretty hopeful, too.,You know, the feeling of the,films was something optimistic.,As your teacher, Mr. Spock,,is fond of saying,,I like to think that there,always are possibilities.,They weren't cynical. Somehow,that really affect us.,There's a feeling,to those movies...,Aloha, Spicoli.,a sense of wonder that,is just in all of them,,and that's something,that to this day I chase,and try to capture,,'cause you really wanna,pass it on to people.,So, when you're,a kid, kid experiences,,it's about people,,scenery, books, movies...,That's what imprints on you.,The works of art, for example,,that you fall in love with,,that are most lasting.,You see ""Star Trek"" at age 12.,You know, if it's any good,,it's going to be major.,Or maybe even if,it's not any good,,it's gonna be major.,That's when you're,really consuming,art, movies, and music,that shape and mold you to who,you become later on as an adult.,You can't separate people,my age from the movies,of the early '80s,because they're so part,of who we were growing up.,We were,free-range kids.,We got to go out. Our,parents were like, ""Hey, man,,come home when the sun goes,down. Be home for dinner."",My parents didn't,know what I did.,They just knew you had,gone off for the day,,and you'd be home,for dinner, maybe.,Ride our,bike somewhere.,Nobody cared. We had,our secret lives.,Even if ""E.T."" wasn't,about an alien,,kids today would think it,was a science fiction movie,because the kids leave in,the morning on bicycles.,Their parents don't,know where they are.,They show back up at dinner.,Parents don't ask,where they were.,They're not calling,'em on cellphones.,That was the life we had.,I'm a proud geek, was one,before it became fashionable.,Yeah, which I'm a,little bitter about...,because I feel,like I had to choose,between cultivating,being attractive,or reading comic books.,Look, an authentic voodoo doll.,And now you can,technically do both,,and that's a little frustrating.,Everything felt awesome,,and the movies really,reflected that.,When you get to '82, we're,coming out of Watergate,,we're coming out of Vietnam era.,Everyone's having a good time.,Yeah. Britain went,to war with Argentina,over the Falkland Islands,,but it wasn't any,kind of huge wars.,It coincided with,a time in America,where everything,seemed possible.,Reagan was in power. People,were more optimistic,,The economy was better, and,the movies sort of reflect,a sunnier, more fairy tale time.,Who would have ever,thought that Ronald Reagan,,the former movie star,,that he would be the President,of the United States?,- Bonzo!,- Mr. Boyd!,Bonzo, that wasn't,a nice thing to do.,The oldest President of the,United States at the time.,You don't,really become president.,The presidency is,an institution,,and you have temporary,custody of it.,That was all part of it.,It was all part of the fantasy,landscape that we lived in.,It was morning in America.,I wasn't politically aware.,I didn't know about,Ronald Reagan's,sort of politics.,I mean, I didn't know that I,didn't agree with the politics.,You just felt good,to be American.,The groundwork has been laid,,and now we will move,forward to capitalize,on the tremendous potential,offered by the ultimate,frontier of space.,The '80s became about,Reaganomics and making money.,People were feeling good,,so they wanted to play.,But I feel like it was more of,a social-physical interaction,with the entertainment,that we had back then.,When I think of 1982,,I think of the arcade,as being the clubhouse,of the teenage people.,The joke is that,teenagers have to find,their own place because,they're not civil yet.,That's why I loved being,a young teenager in 1982,,because part of going,to the movies is you had,to go to the movies,to see the movie.,We didn't have the,internet at our fingertips.,We didn't have the opportunity,to have everything on demand.,You couldn't press a,button and suddenly,have these things appear.,You had to work for it.,You had to take a chance.,Sometimes you'd ask the guy,who sold you the,ticket, ""What's good?"",Our idea of social media,was standing on line,waiting three hours,to get into a film,where we would talk about our,enthusiasm, our excitement.,It's the fun, the excitement.,We get out here with all our,friends, and it's a good time.,Waiting in line is,even a good time.,You're like, ""Oh, I'm not,going to see this movie today,"",'cause there'd be a long,line around the block.,Why are movies,called blockbusters?,Because the anticipated movies,have people lined,up around the block.,I did like when there,were less choices,and people watched,movies together.,The experience that you have,when you are part of an audience,is an experience that is,intensely intimate and personal,and collective at the same time.,We've gone on this,journey together.,We have shared something.,People we didn't even know,next to us laughing, crying,,doing whatever it was,,sharing that,unifying human bond.,Stepping back from what makes,going to the movies magical,,we have to look at,entertainment as medicinal.,It takes us out of our pain.,It takes us out of our,trauma and allows us,to go someplace where we can,feel safe for those two hours,and not worry,about our troubles.,These days, with the,way the world is,,there's a lot to escape from,,so it's a good bet that,many Americans this spring,will be going to that galaxy,long ago and far, far away.,I think that's one of the,things that whenever anybody,dismisses fandom of any kind,,my first thought is that,you don't really understand,what it is to hurt in,a way as an adolescent,and to find solace and safety.,At that time, certainly for me,,growing up in a,very abusive home,,movies were my safe space.,Why wouldn't I want,to stand in line,to have that ticket,to peace and escape?,Recently, it's hard not,to look back on 1982,and see it as a pioneering,time for original stories.,Some of the formulas,that we would now say,,""Oh, this is a formulaic movie,"",sometimes you were seeing that,formula for the first time,you know, in '82.,Telling you, man, I've been,in places like this before,,and white cops came and,with me and my friends.,The only thing that stopped,us from kicking their,is they had guns and badges.,Takes years of experience,to handle a joy like this.,Wanna bet?,As you move into,this new decade,,and you've got the benefit,of technology behind them,,they were like, how,do we make a story,that people care about that,also looks unbelievable,,like nothing that's,ever come before?,There is nothing like,that spirit of innovation,when everything,was new and iconic.,The movies that got,made are jaw-dropping.,Was an unbelievable year,for culture in America.,It didn't feel,that way at the time.,I didn't think I'm in,the midst of a golden,,you know, rainbow here.,- What about ""Swords of Glory""?,- Crap.,- ""Amarillo."",- Crap.,- ""Sands of the Sudan."",- Crap.,Benjy, you want to see,movies? Get a job as an usher.,The rest of us are here to write,professional show,business comedy.,Now, looking back,,I say we'd be lucky,to get half as many good,films right now.,It was kind of a magical time,when the commerce,was supporting art,in a way that created,lasting legacy films,,so we get the best,of all worlds,,because somehow culture and,money meet around that time.,You sort of see the,auteurist filmmaking,converging with the,blockbuster mentality,,so you have people,like Paul Schrader,doing ""Cat People"",for Universal.,You have somebody like Nick,Meyer doing ""Star Trek II."",You have these really,original visions,merging with more,commercial sensibilities.,So many of these,movies feel so personal,even when they're in,the mainstream space.,These film brats were,telling you everything,about what was important to them,and what they had,loved growing up,,and that's what all,these genre movies were.,Could you even imagine,what the conversations,were like at that time?,""We're going to,make an entire movie,with puppets, no people,,and it's gonna cost just as,much as a movie with people.,It's gonna be risky and crazy,,and we're gonna take chances."",That's the spirit of,""We're going to do something,that no one has done before."",A lot of those movies in '82,would never be made these days,because they are risky.,Studios don't want to take,risks the way that they used to.,No one actually can,make a creative decision,without someone sitting down,and doing a spreadsheet on it.,I mean, when you look at 1982,,the number of successes seem,to really outweigh the,number of failures.,I would say to the people,making the decisions,,you know, maybe take,a few more chances.,We are living in the age of IP,and... and sort of IP hackery,in a sense that, like,,movies do not exist,or have any sort of,support unless they are,an existing property,of some kind.,With the new way in,which they decide,what big movies are made,,you'd never have a,""Star Wars"" today,,you'd never have,an ""Indiana Jones."",Back then, these,decisions on what to make,were made with instinct,,not algorithms.,I went out with a,movie a few years ago,,and all the studios said,it was a great script,,but they were passing,on it, and finally,,the very last studio,that passed on it,,I went to the head of,the studio, and I said,,""I don't understand this.,Everyone's saying how much,they love the script,and no one's making it.,Why won't you make it?"",And he said, ""Well, it's not,based on something else."",And I said, ""Well, you made,'Independence Day' with me.,That wasn't based,on something else."",And he goes, ""I,wouldn't make it today,unless you called it,'War of the Worlds.'"",It's sad, and I,think it ultimately,hurt the movie business.,There were over nine,studios at the time.,I think there's four now.,This consolidation really,stifles competition,,and the good thing,about competition was,everyone wants to try and,do something different.,That year is when I was hired,by ""Entertainment Tonight"",to be a film critic,on their show.,I think audiences are,responding to sequels,when the sequels are good.,I don't think there's any,other criteria that they have.,If the word of mouth,gets out that a sequel,is just a ripoff and is,,uh, taking them for a ride,,so to speak, they're,not going to show up.,It was the first,show of its kind,,but the other phenomena,was Siskel and Ebert,,longtime newspaper,critics in Chicago,,but their television show,made them household names.,Imagine, film critics,becoming household names.,1982 was the best,year at the box office,in the last 30 years.,You never saw people talk this,passionately about art on TV.,Gene and Roger,were not scripted,,and they disagreed, and,it was fun to watch.,It seemed to me that,""Sophie's Choice"",was about the fragility of love.,I don't get the treachery,of the hearts bit.,I also don't agree with you,that this film's that good.,- We disagree.,- Okay.,In 1982, Tribune hires them,to do a syndicated show,called ""At the Movies."",It's immediately success.,They became the,nation's movie critics.,And they end up really,influencing what people see.,With the success of,Siskel and Ebert,,this idea of, well, you've,got two guys together,,and are they doing two,thumbs up or one thumb down?,And suddenly it became about,aggregation of two critics,,which then led on,to Rotten Tomatoes,and this whole idea of,aggregating critics.,The strongest,memory I have of that year,was the second week of June.,And no other month,before or since,has matched the quality,of June of 1982.,That's the month and the year,that I officially fell,in love with movies.,Sometimes two or,three classic movies,opening on the same weekend,,and it's like, jeez,,what do you choose?,On June 4, 1982,,you had ""Star Trek II:,The Wrath of Khan,"",and ""Poltergeist"" opening,on the same freaking day.,One week later, June 11th,,you have ""E.T. the,Extra-Terrestrial."",For, like, decades, it was like,the highest grossing,movie of all time.,All of a sudden, there are,two Steven Spielberg movies,coming out within a,week of each other,,and the first one that,came out was ""Poltergeist."",""Poltergeist"" was another film,that was fanciful in nature,,with some scares built into it,,almost any age group,could and did respond to.,I think it was,using the child...,Hello?,Being sucked into,the television.,She was so tuned in.,She was truly an empath,,and she was 5.,Mike Fenton and I were casting,""Poltergeist"" and ""E.T."",almost simultaneously.,So Heather O'Rourke,initially came in for ""E.T."",Steven saw her at the,commissary, and he's like,,""Oh, you should really come,in for... for 'Poltergeist.'"",They're here.,It went more for the,heart than for the scare.,Reach back into our past when,you used to have an open mind.,- Remember that?,- Uh-huh.,Okay. Just try to use that.,I remember less the,moments I jumped,than I do how much I was,rooting for these people.,Whoo-hoo! Whoo!,Stephen and Tobe both felt,very strongly that the family,was the most important aspect.,- Good night, sweetie.,- Good night.,Okay, lights out.,Closet light! Closet light!,My fault. My fault.,Turn it on, Mommy!,Tobe really had a real,sense of the horror,,how to create the darker moods,,but I think it was,Steven's influence,to keep the family stuff really,strong in the foreground.,That was the key in all,of Spielberg's movies,,is that it really,focused on the heart.,Are you with us now?,Can you... Can you,say hello to Daddy?,Hello, Daddy.,Hello, sweet pea.,A lot of this comes,back to verisimilitude,,these art forms,finding a reality,that's much closer to,your own experience,,your own lived experience,than you expect it to be.,Can you see Mommy?,Mommy,,where are you? Where are you?,Why can't it be fantastic and,very real at the same time?,Just sort of based the,lifestyle on a lifestyle,I'm familiar with, growing up,in suburban Phoenix, Arizona,,in tract homes with,cul-de-sacs and 2-car garages.,And this suburban,lifestyle breeds,a certain kind of individual.,Seeing the parents in,their bedroom at night,,trying to hide a,joint from the family,,you know, I'd never seen,that in a movie before.,Hi, honey.,Is everything okay?,And yet it still felt,like a wholesome family.,Also has, like, super,babelicious mom and dad.,Like, this...,Like, that era,,they're, like, very hot,,cool mom and dad characters,,but it's also scary.,""Poltergeist"",scared me straight to 1983.,Static on a television,still scares me,,and we all owned TVs,like that in 1982.,I'm like, no, I'm,not here for that.,I don't understand the title.,I still don't know,what it means.,- What does ""poltergeist"" mean?,- No one knew what it was.,We found a... We found,a German book, uh,,that had... it,was ""poltergeist,"",And, uh, it was all in,German, so, you know,,but we knew it was about ghosts,,and we showed that to Steven.,He said, ""That's the title."",He gave us a page.,There were some bullet,points that he wanted to hit.,He wanted it to be,a ghost story set,in a middle class,housing development,,that the ghost,comes out of the TV.,It had originally,been written by,Michael Grace and Mark Victor,,but Steven Spielberg,wrote the shooting draft.,We only had six weeks,to write the screenplay,because we were set,to go on strike.,Film was in production, and we,were striking our own movie.,Steven sent a PA out to get,us from the line...,'cause he said, ""I think,you guys want to see this."",It's a really cool scene.,So we went in, and we saw,the room was on a gimbal,,and it turned,around and all this.,Steven is a strong producer.,He was the guy who brought,Tobe Hooper in to direct.,He was quite generous,,offering it to this,guy who had only done,the genius ""Texas Chain,Saw"" and then ""Eaten Alive."",It's very intimidating to have,the world's most successful,filmmaker producing your movie,and kind of talking about how,to do what he saw in his mind,as a screenwriter.,I was on the set,of ""Poltergeist,"",and I watched it happen.,This thing is,growing out of her,,and it's getting,larger and larger,,and the shoulders are almost,going up to the ceiling.,Just when you begin to see,the fingers, it goes, whoosh!,Breaks up like blowing a,smoke ring apart in the air,and then goes shooting up,into the area by location.,He's an enthusiastic filmmaker.,You know, he says, ""Hey,,what about a two shot here?"",And we move in, and Tobe was,hesitant to come in and say,,""Well, how about this?"",The collaboration,between Tobe and Steven,was very interesting.,Steven was there. He,was there every day,,and I think truly, Steven,wanted to direct it himself,,but because he was,going to do ""E.T.,"",he couldn't really do both,,and his price was too high.,He was getting ready,to shoot ""E.T.,"",and he was under a,contractual obligation,to Universal to make ""E.T.,"",which meant he couldn't work,on another film as a director.,What we saw there was that,Tobe was in the,director's chair,,and Steven was standing,right behind him,with his hands on,the chair.,Tobe, I think, respected,Steven and went along with it.,I'm sure it was very,hard on Tobe in many ways,'cause Steven is a,strong personality.,I think the result really,had both influences.,Tobe directed the movie.,He called ""action"" and ""cut."",His creative,influence was there,,but both of those,men made that movie.,Yes, there were a lot of,fights about who did it,,but it was not between,the two of them.,It was a collaboration,,but doesn't feel,like a Hooper movie.,It feels like a Spielberg movie.,""Poltergeist"" does feel,like a Spielberg film,,but it is absolutely the lensing,and framing of a,Tobe Hooper film.,I'm embarrassed to say I,cried in ""Poltergeist."",I remembered being so,connected to Heather,,but I had no idea that it,would be that well received,,not only critically,,but at the box office.,I think that movie is,the perfect metaphor,for the summer of 1982,because Tangina says...,This house has many hearts.,And the summer of,1982 has many hearts.,MGM has ""Poltergeist"",for release on June 4th.,This Steven Spielberg production,is about a suburban family,terrorized in their,spooky new house.,""Poltergeist"" is,anxiously awaited,by those who like to have,the heck scared out of them.,They're here.,Also from the mind of,Steven Spielberg is,""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."",Little is known about this film,except that it stars,a friendly alien,,lost and alone, 100,000,light-years from home.,I had just joined the staff,of a still-new television show,called ""Entertainment,Tonight,"" or ""E.T,"",and along came a movie called,""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial."",What a glorious movie... A,film that reminded the child,inside you that there was,still such a thing as wonder,,that that was a quality that,you didn't have to discard,just because you're growing,older chronologically.,For me, the pinnacle of,Steven Spielberg's career.,Since then, they've,come up with this jargon,about four-quadrant movies.,Screw the quadrants. He just,knew how to tell a great story,that would have broad appeal.,The craziest thing is that,""E.T."" started off,as a horror film.,It began as an unofficial,sequel to ""Close Encounters."",Columbia wanted,Spielberg to do a sequel,,and he wasn't that,interested in the sequel.,He came up with the,idea for ""Night Skies,"",which was aliens,landing at a farm,and attacking a farm family.,It was, uh, he described it as,""Guns Along the Mohawk,"",um, with aliens,,and it was a horror film.,The screenplay was,written by John Sayles.,Ron Cobb was going to direct it.,Steven Spielberg was going,to be the executive producer.,They had this basic idea,based on research,Spielberg had done when he was,working on ""Close Encounters""...,This, uh, incident that had,happened in a rural farm,where the people claimed,that they had been surrounded,by these little E.T.s.,and this is during the cattle,and horse mutilation period.,They're inside. The things,are trying to break in,and, uh, fought them off with,shotguns and various things.,And Rick Baker took the time,and designed these five aliens.,They are pretty spectacular.,The lead alien is,pretty terrifying.,He's got this long, bony,finger with a blade,,and that's what he's cutting,and dissecting the cattle with.,There was a character,in the story,who was a friendly alien,,and there was a young child,in the story who was autistic,,and Buddy and the autistic,boy created a connection.,When he's clicking,with this alien,,it's, like, touching,,and John Sayles just nails,these scenes of this alien,and this boy while all,this horror is going on.,They had this plan, and,it all kind of fell apart,,because eventually what,Steven Spielberg realized,was that that wasn't the movie.,I think it was at Columbia,then, and they said,,""Oh, we've got this other movie,,'Starman, ' with Jeff Bridges.,We're not going to make some,big space fantasy for kids,when we've already,got a space movie,"",and I think that's when he,moved to another studio,,and with that move, I,think, kind of rethought it.,So he rethought it,with Melissa Mathison.,She had co-written the script,for ""The Black Stallion."",She was also Harrison,Ford's girlfriend.,She was with Harrison,on location in Tunisia,when they were doing,""Raiders of the Lost Ark."",They got together,,and they, you know,,really didn't take much,from... From what I had done.,The ending of the,script, I think,,is what probably got her,,because the last,paragraph of the script,,Buddy, the nice alien,,is, like, kind of lost,,walking around terrified, like,a stranger in a strange world.,And because you see his,relationship with the boy,throughout the whole movie,,and just to know that he's now,stuck on Earth all by himself,,it's like a,heartbreaking ending.,Like, you really,feel bad for him.,And that ending of ""Night Skies"",is the jumping off,point of ""E.T."",It was, really,,what about this thing,,of this ""E.T."" who gets left,behind? Wouldn't that be cool?,The intersection,of the two scripts,is that I got to read it.,When the Writers Guild,said, ""Well, you were one,of the writers who,was near this thing.,Do you think you should get,any credit?"" I just said,,""No, not at all, but,this is really good."",If Spielberg can,keep the budget down,,he's got a nice little,Disney movie here.,It got put into turnaround,,and then Universal was like,,""Hey, Columbia, could we,just, like, buy that off you?"",This story goes that Universal,gave Columbia 5% as the gift,,thank-you for selling,them the script,and getting it,out of turnaround.,And quietly, Columbia said,they made more off that 5%,than any of their,studio's films that year.,Okay, Mom, you can look now.,Aah!,Oh, that's great!,Stay there!,I auditioned,for ""Used Cars,"",and I didn't get it,,but Steven works very far ahead.,He was already playing,around with ""E.T.,"",and he knew whatever,adult appeared in there,,he wanted them to be childlike.,And so when ""E.T."" came about,,they called and offered me...,Bye!,The role of Mary.,They had me come,over to the studio,,and in a room behind,a locked door,,I read what was,entitled ""A Boy's Life."",And I remember calling my,agents on a rotary phone,and saying, ""You know,,I don't know how much,this is gonna do for me,,but I think it's gonna,do a lot for the world,,and I really wanna be,a part of this film."",E.T...,home phone.,E.T. phone home.,It's not a film about divorce,,but it is about the,after effects of it,,and that comes from,Spielberg's own life as well.,His depiction of families,,like this incredibly,naturalistic depiction,that he had in,""Close Encounters"",and in ""Poltergeist,"",the fact that in ""E.T.,"",that felt like the most real,version of sitting around,a dinner table to someone,who had a brother and sister.,What are you going,as for Halloween?,- Not going to stupid Halloween.,- Why don't you go as a goblin?,Shut up.,We're dropping in on,these people's lives.,There was a clutter,to the house.,There was a lived-in,sense to the house.,Messy homes, messy lives.,I remember the moment I,walked onto the soundstage,,and E.T. was,standing over there,,and I walked in,,and I just stopped,,and I looked at him and I went,,""Oh, my God. He's beautiful."",I mean, you just got,him right away...,All the love that the movie,brings forward through him.,Carlo Rambaldi did,such an amazing job,capturing the heart of who E.T.,was in his face and his eyes.,On three.,One... two... three.,No! Stop it!,No!,And cut. Cut.,We all saw E.T. as another,character that we worked with,,and for the kids,,Steven went to incredible,feats of keeping E.T. alive.,- And...,- He's really real.,- Crazy story.,- Then why all those wires?,These aren't wires.,Those are his feet.,Do you know that?,They would stick the hydraulic,E.T. over in a corner.,Well, one day we found,Drew talking to him.,So after that, Steven,had two guys on that E.T.,the whole time,,so he could make movements,and blink and do his head,so that Drew kept that,illusion of life about E.T.,What E.T. represents,,it's just imagination.,And when the adults come,,they're coming to destroy,this kid's imagination.,How other people are,allowed to see E.T...,It's from Elliott being like,,""I want you to see,my imagination."",Grown-ups can't see him.,Only little kids can see him.,I remember Mike,Fulmer and his team,were building the,miniature bikes,,and I think it was Tom St.,Amand sculpted the kids,,and he had to,sculpt a little E.T.,to put in the basket.,Well, on his desk were,these photos of E.T.,,and I remember,looking at it, going,,""Oh, my God, this is the,ugliest thing I have ever seen.,No one is gonna see this,movie,"" and I was so wrong.,""E.T."",was done in secret.,The teaser was just,clouds with lights.,You knew that it was gonna be,something to do with aliens,,but you had no idea,what ""E.T."" was.,Even I, who'd read Starlog,,I'd read everything about ""E.T."",I didn't know what it was about.,Late May, they had,theatrical sneak previews,around the country,,and it just so,happened that in Fargo,,they had... they had one of,these, so I went to the theater,and had this experience,with this movie,that just blew me away.,And the movie obviously,hadn't opened widely yet,,so nobody else had seen it,,and I'm sitting here,trying to tell people,,like, what it was that I,had seen and experienced.,You just couldn't do,it. People looked at you,like you were...,Like you were crazy.,We went over and stood in,line at the Cinerama Dome,with everybody else for,three hours to see ""E.T."",People were screaming,,they were crying,,they were applauding.,It was the discovery,of that summer.,I'm getting chills,even thinking about it.,It was one of the most,magically transporting,movies I'd ever seen.,No matter who you were,or what ethnicity you were,,you could see yourself,in that story.,That's what made,""E.T."" so special.,Like, when Elliot,takes off on the bike,,that's not Elliott on the,bike. That was me on the bike.,That was me trying,to get E.T. home.,That's the gift that,Steven Spielberg possesses.,My acting teacher, who,is this Cuban émigré...,...who spoke,very strangely, um...,uh, had seen a,movie that changed his life.,He said...,""I've seen the best,performance by an actor ever.,It is the E.T."",E.T., E.T., E.T. be good.,And I remember being,so excited because, uh,,'cause E.T. totally transported,me, and I bought it.,I 100% bought that this,was an alien creature.,You know, I know Carlo,Rambaldi designed it,,and an army of technicians,brought him to life.,For my acting teacher, who,was my God at the time,,they had brought to the screen,the greatest performance ever.,Steven asked me,during the filming...,He said, ""Dee, they're already,asking me about doing a sequel."",He said, ""What do you think?"",And I said...,""I think you should leave it,the classic it's gonna be."",I'll...,be...,right...,here.,Bye.,""E.T."" did a great,job with marketing,because I still have ""E.T."",toys and ""E.T."" everything.,Like, you had to have,some sort of ""E.T."" toy,so your friends,knew you were cool.,E.T., E.T.,My kids are wild about ""E.T."",Now there's a whole,collection of ""E.T."" toys.,- This one talks.,- Home.,The movie comes out.,Initially, there's no toys.,Spielberg realizes his mistake,,immediately,greenlights everything.,They were literally,chartering the 747s,with no passengers,,filling the plane with,the ""E.T."" things.,Luckily for Spielberg,and everybody who had,points on the movie,,the movie was in the,theaters for almost a year.,So by the time it came, the,merch still did very well.,There was an ""E.T."" game. We,actually had the ""E.T."" game.,I remember it. It,was really hard.,No one could win it.,""E.T."" video game? Wow.,It's the video game,that lets you,pretend you're E.T.,Basically, this game,comes out based on ""E.T.,"",and it's... it's not a good game.,It's a really frustrating game.,I remember just, you know,,not really getting it,and not in a not getting,""Blade Runner"" kind of way.,It was more like it,just wasn't fun to play.,You play for two screens,,and all of a sudden,,ET's in a hole again. It's,just... It's just a terrible game.,A video game's the,opposite of a movie.,It's how fun it is to,play that's important.,It's not a passive experience.,It's not something,you're watching.,The ""E.T."" video game,probably was the start,of what is a long lineage,of crappy adaptations,of mainstream media.,If this worked in this genre,,those people, those geeks,,are gonna like this, too.,I don't think Steven,Spielberg felt that way.,I mean, he likes,playing video games.,Best game... the game,that I still think,is the best game...,- ""Centipede."",they've ever made,is ""Asteroids."",I do think there was this hubris,on the part of the people,running Atari at the time,that, ""Well, it's gonna,say. 'E.T.' on the box,"",and they loved 'E.T.',Right? Isn't that enough?"",You would go into like,a Sears or a JCPenney.,The video game section,would just be nothing,but stacks of ""E.T."",If any game ever deserved,to be headed for a landfill,,it was Atari's ""E.T."",Literally, There was this,urban legend that Atari,was so ashamed of the game,that they buried all the unsold,cartridges in this landfill.,It was a far more,interesting and nuanced story,than I thought.,""E.T."" just seemed,like a crappy game,that was made way too quickly,,and that's the,story that was told,and became kind of,the urban legend.,The day that Warner inked,a deal with Spielberg,,they set in motion a disaster.,It was Atari trying to achieve,sales through a license.,Now at Toys 'R' Us, the,new ""E.T."" cartridge,,only $33.97.,Help E.T. phone home with,the Atari Video Game System,,now just $124.87.,But it takes a,lot of negotiating,and a lot of time and such,,And by the time they,were done with a deal,,it was schedule driving,a game development,,which is never a good idea.,The deal was inked in August,,and the cartridge had to be,ready for release November 1st.,At that time, it,took a full year,to fully create a cartridge,,vet it, test it, tweak it.,So you had September,,October... Two months.,The probability of,creating a good game,in that amount of time is zero.,And the creator of ""E.T."",did a fantastic job,for the amount of,time he was given.,He actually only had,,like, five weeks,,and we typically took 10 months.,The heart of the,creative process,is the programmer.,I try and create basically,a sensory experience,that evokes a certain,feeling in the user.,I mean, I tend to,program from a concept.,Poor Howard signed up for it,,and he's been panned as,creating the worst game ever.,No, he created,the best game ever,that had ever been,done in two months.,Only from Atari, made especially,for systems from Atari.,The video game that lets,you help E.T. get home,just in time for Christmas.,Happy holidays from Atari.,Video games were so important,because it allows kids,to feel like they,are independent,,and they're having an,adventure in and of themselves,outside of their,parents' control.,It empowered a lot of people,who are not necessarily,good at sports,to all of a sudden,get street cred.,1982 is the... the peak,for the video game...,Original early video game boom.,First of all, you think about,all of the great video games.,One of my favorite,games was ""Pitfall!"",""Pitfall!""... designed by,David Crane for Activision.,It was Indiana Jones.,They didn't call it,""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"",but that's what it was.,I'll assume I was influenced,to put it in a jungle,instead of somewhere else,because of a popular movie.,No one ever seen anything,like that before.,I only had eight,bits to work with,,eight pixels to make a,character that looks human.,You felt like you were,drawn into this story.,Just last night, I was lost in,the jungle with Pitfall Harry,,surrounded by giant scorpions,and man-eating crocodiles.,There were three,different consoles,that were all very popular.,There was the Mattel,Intellivision.,Mr. Intellivision, how come,all you ever talk about,are sports games?,- Sorry?,Intellivision now has,games like the arcade.,I know.,Magnavox Odyssey.,More than 40 games in all.,Odyssey... The,excitement of a game,,the mind of a computer.,It was also the Atari,2600 or the VCS,,they called it back then.,More color, more,sound, and more action,,and naturally, it's from Atari.,Atari was almost like the,Apple of the time. It was huge.,The reason why you,see a big ""Atari"" logo,in ""Blade Runner"" is,nobody at the time,would have ever thought,Atari would go downhill.,Well, I was watching ""Blade,Runner,"" loved the movie.,It was this vision,of the future,,and there was the Atari logo.,And I said, ""Yo!""",http://subslikescript.com/movie/1982_Greatest_Geek_Year_Ever-15035478

Svengali (1931) - full transcript,"Sinister music maestro Svengali can control the actions of women through hypnotism and his telepathic powers. When a pupil he has seduced announces she has left her husband for him, he uses his powers to cause her suicide and promptly forgets her. He meets a beautiful model, Trilby, and becomes infatuated with her, but she, in turn, falls for a young artist called Billee who also loves her. One day Svengali hypnotizes Trilby to cure her headache, but also examines her upper palate and decides it is an ideal cavity for great singing. He convinces her to fake her suicide, so Billee and friends will forget her, and goes on a singing tour with her. Svengali uses his powers to make her sing wonderfully and Madame Svengali, as Trilby is now known, becomes a sensation throughout Europe. But Billee discovers the ruse and begins to follow the pair, upsetting Svengali enough to have him cancel performances too frequently, so they no longer can perform in Europe. They go to Egypt, but Billee relentlessly follows.","[ Door knocks ],Madame Honori.,- Bonsoir, Gecko.,Madame.,Monsieur?,Monsieur?,Monsieur is composing.,Oh.,Composing.,You will wait?,Svengali.,Ah, Madame .. je suis enchantée.,

Aquarius (2016) - full transcript,"Clara, a 65 year old widow and retired music critic, was born into a wealthy and traditional family in Recife, Brazil. She is the last resident of the Aquarius, an original two-storey building, built in the 1940s, in the upper-class, seaside Boa Viagem Avenue, Recife. All the neighboring apartments have already been acquired by a company which has other plans for that plot. Clara has pledged to only leave her place upon her death, and will engage in a cold war of sorts with the company. This tension both disturbs Clara and gives her that edge on her daily routine. It also gets her thinking about her loved ones, her past and her future.","Part 1 :,Clara's Hair,Anyway...,I brought this song.,And i think you'll like it.,What is it?,-Let me play it, man.,-You're so curious.,Let's see how good,your stereo is.,I'm playing it loud, alright?,Go ahead, play it loud.,It will be loud.,Hold on there, Martin and Isabela.,That sounds good.,

not.,You're wrong.,She'll call me at the,hotel in the morning,,or your 280 in front.,Well let's use that as taxi fare.,What was the name of that hotel again?,Bailey's Hotel, Knightsbridge.,Now any other transport to London,since 1300 hours?,Freight and four crew at 1430 hours,and Flight 408, lead plane,,15 passengers at 1600 hours.,Checked all permits?,Naturally.,Civilian as well as service.,Alright, I want your passenger list,for Flight 402 right away.,Meanwhile get me a line,through to Crossbow.,Right sir, this way please.,Mh, what's up, Coutts?,I wouldn't have called you back Major,,but this seemed pretty urgent.,Was it in code?,No sir, direct phone,from Intelligence, Berlin.,Body of Major Carl Alexis Scamel,found under rubble near Carlstrasse.,1721 hours, identification positive.,Man travelling London,,Flight 402, an impostor.,That's right.,Scamel, that's that intelligence officer,Fentriss was talking about this morning.,Exactly Keen.,And there's another bit of,information I've leaned since.,Oh?,Thank you Coutts.,All indications are that the impostor,is a cove we've been after for years.,He's been tank familiar recap in Europe,,but he's always kept just one jump ahead.,What's this character's name?,He's known as Dumetrius.,Dumetrius.,And I'd better warn you,that he's cunning, ruthless,,completely unscrupulous,,and will stop at nothing,,including murder.,Can you give me a,full description of him?,We haven't got a clue.,We've grilled half the Polish,suspects in the country,,forged passport game.,They've never actually seen him either.,What about the other,passengers on the plane?,Well there were only four.,Here's the list,of their names and,addresses from Intelligence.,Digby Mitchel, Birmingham,,we'll get him tonight.,Ridgeway, RESC, staying,Bobbing Hill, Kent.,H. Godowski, USAF, Bailey's,Hotel, Knightsbridge.,Yeah, we might start with him.,I doubt if you see much of him,until the small hours either.,But of course if there's,an attractive enough blonde,in one of the nightclubs, he,might leave the scene then.,Well that leaves just,the passenger female one,,Flat seven, Kenilworth Court.,Women are usually pretty observant,,maybe she could give us a description.,Well we could try there first, sir.,Yeah.,What's her name again?,Ms. Hedy Bergner.,Yeah?,Good evening.,Are you Ms. Hedy Bergner?,That's my name, what is it?,Well I'm sorry to disturb,you at this time of night,but something very important has come up,that I'm afraid won't wait.,My name is Keen, may we come in.,Well I suppose so.,Thank you.,But, what is it?,Oh this is Sergeant Coutts.,Good evening miss.,Sergeant?,You are officers of the police?,No, we're from military intelligence.,I understand that you arrived,by plane today from Berlin.,Yeah, today I arrived from Berlin.,Well it would seem that,one of your fellow passengers,is suspected of being,involved in a murder.,Oh no.,And we'd like to get,a description of him,as soon as possible.,But what do you want with me?,In addition to yourself,there was an American pilot, a civilian,,a British officer, and this fourth man,dressed in the uniform of a British major.,Now what can you tell us about him?,British major?,Yes, wearing crowns miss.,Oh.,Do you recall him, can you,tell us what he looked like.,I think so.,He was very tall.,I expect he was around 40.,He sounded English.,Oh fine, you were talking to him then.,Oh no, no, no, no.,I heard him speak before,we went on the plane.,Oh, I see.,Well then perhaps you can,remember something about him,,some detail, some mannerism, or something.,I am sorry, I did not,notice him, I was very tired.,I paid the man no attention.,Oh that's too bad.,Well if you do happen to,remember anything about him later,I'd appreciate it very much,if you'd phone me at,this number right here.,I will Mr. Keen.,Major Keen.,Major dressed like that?,Let's not worry about me.,It's that man on the plane,,that's the one I'm interested in.,I am sorry that I can,not be of more help.,You see, the man did not give me,his telephone number as you have,,usually the men ask me for mine.,I can believe that.,Well now you will be here,if we want to get in touch with you again?,Here or at Marsotti's Club.,I'm going to be working there soon.,Why don't you drop by sometime?,Well thank you very much.,Might at that.,Major Keen.,Ms. Bergner.,- Goodnight.,- Goodnight miss, thank you.,This is Dr. Buchmann's sanitarium.,Who is it?,Oh, good evening my dear.,So?,Dumetrius will not be pleased to hear,that you have already been questioned.,You said nothing of the photograph?,I am no fool, Buchmann.,Of course I said nothing.,Did he check the address I gave you?,Naturally it was correct.,Yes, of course.,Your Major Keen is not the only,one who doesn't waste time.,Dumetrius and Yotti left for a,Bailey's Hotel two hours ago.,If my head isn't gonna bounce,up and down in the morning,I'd better get a shower.,Again?,I've never met an English man yet,who didn't spend more than,half his life in the bathroom.,Ow.,Surely frightfully hold, top.,I'll be seeing you pal.,Ah, now where's my flash attachment?,Now what did I do with that darn camera?,Oh, there it is.,Hey, that was a quick shower.,Hey, who the devil are you.,Leave it, find the camera.,British officer.,Right for the army captain,who was on the plane with me.,It's unfortunate.,For him, yes.,Get it.,That's one photograph,I admit they'll never develop.,Godowski!,Hey Godowski, wake up in there.,Get him over here.,Hey Godowski, open up.,Probably snoring it off.,Take a bomb to wake him.,Well I hate to spoil his beauty sleep,but this thing can't wait.,Tell you what,,go down and ask the night,porter for his pass key.,Okay.,Put the knife in his hand.,I do not finish him, as well?,We'll let the law do that for us.,Old fool didn't want to give 'em to me.,This the one?,Yes, that's right.,Ah.,He doesn't snore very loud, does he?,Wait a minute.,Smoke.,Looks like there's someone,else from that plane.,Won't be able to give us a description.,Don't smear the prints.,Gen E Paratroop knife.,Haven't seen one of those for years.,Who are you, where's Godowski?,Alright, just take it,easy bud, Godowski's dead.,Dead?,But, but what happened?,Well we were counting,on you to tell us that.,Who are you?,What the devil's been going on here?,My name is Keen.,Of course now you don't really have to,say anything unless you want to,,but it would help if you could explain,how it happens that Godowski's lying here,stabbed to death.,And you're over here with,the room all torn apart,and a paratrooper's knife in your hand.,But I haven't got a knife, no.,But you did have.,I did?,Yeah.,Have a cigarette.,Now maybe you feel more like talking.,All I know is that I was in the bathroom,and something clouted me,on the back of the head.,Oh now, you can come up,with a better story than that.,You can see the lump can't you?,Yes, and I can also see the,table that you fell against.,Now what happened?,Did you come back drunk,and get into a fight?,Don't be ridiculous, of course not.,What were you doing here anyway?,At Tempelhof you gave your,address as Bobbing Hill, Kent.,Well who the devil are you?,Well I wouldn't start,anything with Coutts.,He's a tough one,,even if he doesn't wear,his green beret anymore.,A commander, were you chump?,Remind me to give you a workout sometime.,It'll be a pleasure.,Let's get to the point.,What do you know about Carl Alexis Scamel?,Scamel?,Well if he was the chap on,the plane not a damn thing.,You don't feel like talking, eh?,Oh for heaven's sake,,are you gonna arrest me or not?,That's usually what happens,in the case of murder.,Look, either you knifed,Godowski in a drunken brawl,or you have something to,do with a man on a plane,who called himself,Scamel, now which is it?,Did you say called himself Scamel?,That's right, or Dumetrius.,Well why don't you make up your mind.,If you're trying to make us believe,that he killed Godowski,to keep Godowski from identifying him,,why didn't he kill you too.,Look here, do you mind,if I get some clothes on,,we talk things over down at the Yard.,You are a detective, I suppose?,American Intelligence,,attached to M.I.5.,No cloak, no dagger.,And no gun, I hope.,Watch him Coutts.,Just gonna get my shirt.,By the way, why don't you have,a look at Godowski's camera.,He had a new roll of film,with only one exposure,,Ms. Hedy Bergner, and I didn't remove it.,Capture him Coutts!,Down there, down the alley.,Come on, down the,front, we can cut him off.,He's up in there, in that doorway.,Alright, Ridgeway, come on out of there!,Come on Ridgew...,what are you doing here miss?,What's your name?,My name's Sally Jennings.,I don't know if it's any,business of yours what I'm doing.,Well it is our business,,we're looking for an escaped criminal.,Well I haven't seen,any escaped criminal.,Well have you seen,anyone at all come by here?,No I haven't, only you two,,and that's the reason,why I dodged in here.,Well I'm sorry if we frightened you,,but it is late to be out.,Well if you want to know,I work in a nightclub,,and I don't get home 'til now.,And if it's you some convenience,I'd like to be getting there.,Well where do you live miss?,Just 'round the corner,,24 Lartsbur Street if you must know.,Would you like me to walk back with you,,this bloke might be dangerous, you know.,No thanks I can manage,without a police escort.,Neighbours might talk.,Well it looks as though,we've drawn a blank.,Let's get Inspector Frand at the Yard,to block off this area.,What do you think you're doing?,Be quiet.,I don't want to have to hurt you,,but I'm the fellow they're looking for.,No need to half choke me.,I'm sorry.,Dear, let's have a look at you.,Pete's sake put that out,,you want them to come back for me?,Don't worry, they won't.,In any case, I'm not very,partial to coppers myself.,What have you done?,Nothing.,I'm in trouble up to my neck.,You're not going to,get very far by yourself.,Hurt your leg, haven't you?,It's my ankle.,Busted something when I jumped back there.,I'll be alright in a minute.,Alright, he says.,Well you can hardly stand.,I'll be okay when I get a,cab and find somewhere to go.,That talks a duff.,You'd pass out 'fore you,got to the first cab ran.,Come on.,Where are you taking me?,Home.,Ah, Major Keen.,Hi.,I did not expect you, but do come in.,Thank you.,I'll admit this visit,is a little irregular,,but I didn't want you to have to come down,to our office alone.,I see, but why?,This is a little difficult,to know just how to put this,,I don't want to upset you but,,there's a possibility your,life may be in danger.,My life?,But who would want to kill me?,Someone who was on that,plane with you yesterday.,I do not understand.,You know that young American,,that took the photograph of you,,he was stabbed to death last night.,Oh no.,And the film with your,picture on it was destroyed.,Oh, and you do not know who did it?,No, one of the other,passengers, Ridgeway,,was there under very,suspicious circumstances.,And well we wanted to take him in,,but unfortunately he got away.,Oh, and you have not found him?,Not yet.,Of course it might have,been the other man, Scamel.,Oh, and he too has vanished?,Not a trace.,Oh, I, I am frightened.,I mean, I'm alone here,in a foreign country,,I have no friends and I...,Now that's the last thing,I wanted to do was upset you,,it's just that, well I wanted to warn you,to keep your eyes open for,Ridgeway or this other man,,that's all.,I'll tell you what I'll do,,I'll post a man to watch your,place here night and day.,And if it's alright with you,,well I'd like very much to take you down,to Marsotti's Club myself.,Oh you would be that kind to do that?,You mustn't lose your,nose so soon my dear friend.,I admit, I made an error.,I should have let Yotti have,his way, and finished Ridgeway.,And the other man?,Mitchel?,At the moment he's in Birmingham.,He'd be well advised to stay there.,I need only a few days,to complete the business,that's brought to me to England.,I've destroyed Godowski, I've,destroyed the photograph.,Sooner or later Ridgeway,must contact Hedy,,it's his only chance to,clear himself for the police.,But does he know where?,You should read the,papers my dear friend.,Her appearance at Marsotti's Club,has been featured in most of them.,And you think that he will...,Walk into the trap?,Yes, I shall send Yotti to the club.,You really don't kill Ridgeway there.,It would mean the police and,they might find out about me.,You mean about your little sideline?,Don't worry, Ridgeway,will have to be killed,,but not there.,He's the one person who,could convince M.I.5.,that Hedy is with us.,And Hedy is the one person,who cOuld lead them to me.,Are you sure you're not exaggerating?,About what?,This character, Dumetrius.,Well he's already killed two people,,he certainly isn't,playing for bottle tops.,I wish I could help you,,but I had such a hangover on the plane,I wouldn't have noticed the,bloke even if he had two heads.,Oh no, four people and not one of you,can come out with a word of sense.,It's a bad show, I'm sorry.,You mind if I have another,lash at your whiskey?,Oh, go ahead.,Thanks.,So now you're after Ridgeway?,That's right.,I think you're a darn fool.,Well thanks for the,benefit of your opinion.,I know Ridgeway,,he'd no more shove a knife,into a man than I would.,Forgive me if I'm not impressed.,Look, if you think that I'm drinking,too much of your whiskey,I can always leave a,quid on the mantelpiece.,Oh that isn't what I mean.,Don't you see, I was counting on you.,Tell me, how can you ride,all the way from Berlin,on the same plane and,not even see the man?,Why should I?,I'm not one of your intelligence spies,chasing around with a false beard.,All you blokes are the same,,colonel this and major that,,and all you can do in your spare time,is to run a decent fellow,like Ridgeway into the ground.,Why don't you finish your whiskey,and get back to Birmingham.,I'm staying in town,for a couple of days.,I think Ridgeway needs someone, don't you?,Look if you have any sense,at all in that head of yours,you'll keep out of this.,Don't give me that.,Until Ridgeway's off the,hook I'm declaring myself in.,You know last night I was sure,there was something broken there.,I rubbed Lilly mint into it for now,while you were passed out.,Now why you should have done all this,for a complete stranger, and,one wanted for murder at that,,beats me.,Why did you?,I don't know.,Plain beats me too.,Maybe I've got too much,internal instinct or something.,Could be.,You know you're gonna,need some new clothes.,If you give me the sizes I,can pop out and get them.,Ah, you'll need some money as well.,There you are.,Ta.,Thank you.,You know, what I don't understand,is how whoever did it knew,where to find Godowski.,You'd only been in London a few hours.,Through Hedy Bergner.,Hedy Bergner.,Yeah, she practically fell,all over him at the airport,to get his address.,Why don't you go to Keen and tell him?,With a rope around my neck?,No thank you.,Well you have to do something.,I'm going to.,I'm going after that red headed Delilah,if I've got to search London for her.,Well have the coppers in,London are searching for you.,Ah, she's my only lead.,Listen Sally, Godowski,was a good friend of mine,but they murdered him and,left me to swing for it.,If I can frighten Hedy and make her talk,I shall have something.,Possibly a knife in your back as well.,It's my only chance.,I got to have something to nail 'em with.,Something that I can take to Keen openly.,Well, I must be daft to help you,but you've not far to look.,Well what do you mean?,She's part of the new floor shirt,at the feathers club where I work.,What?,And I could leave a side door open.,This really has happened to us, hm.,Tell me it's not a dream.,No, it's real.,At least on my part it is.,And mine.,And now, I think I almost knew last night,as soon as you came in here.,Me too.,Funny, 24 hours ago I was,just a man on a mission.,And now?,A man in love.,Oh darling, stay in love, always.,No chance of anything else.,To think I waited so,long for this, all my life.,Yeah.,Come to the club tonight darling.,Bring Coutts if you think you,should but, stay with me, hm.,Every second of every minute.,Did you like it darling?,It was beautiful.,Gypsy Rhapsody by Svorski, wasn't it?,Yeah, it's a favourite of mine.,I must go change my dress,before the next number,then I join you.,Oh they're looking after,you Sergeant Coutts?,Yes, yes, fine thanks.,You will wait for me?,Of course I will.,Yes, they're looking after me fine,and after her too, it seems.,What do you mean?,The character by the,door next to Marsotti,,he's an old chum of mine.,Who is he?,A charmer by the name of Yotti Blum.,He's one of the Forged Papers Brigade.,Wonder what he's doing here.,What's his nationality?,Guess is as good as his.,Shouldn't think he's got,enough to show mom and dad.,Probably formed in a sewer in Bucharest.,Wonder if he might know,anything about Ridgeway.,Or something about Godowski.,Why don't we pull him in and ask him.,We might at that.,You don't suppose he's,one of Dumetrius' mob,after Hedy do you?,He might be one of Dumetrius' mob,,but I don't think he's out to get her.,What do you want?,Peter Ridgeway.,Surprised to see me?,The man who killed the American.,I might have to add you,to my list if necessary.,You must be mad.,I want to know who killed Hank Godowski.,Now I know you are crazy.,You went to special,lengths at the airport,to get his address, who for?,For me.,Don't lie.,You wanted his address so that someone,could go to his hotel and kill him.,No, that is not true.,Did you tell your friend Keen downstairs,that you knew where Godowski was going?,He did not ask me.,Godowski didn't even know himself,until five minutes before,the plane left Tempelhof.,I saw the cable.,You were the only one who could,have passed the message on.,Or you.,It won't work Hedy.,Either you tell me or I tell Keen.,You would never give yourself up.,I wouldn't need to.,I've plenty of friends,who could let him know.,I could tell the Major myself,that I asked for Godowski's address.,Look a bit odd, won't it?,If you suddenly remember.,What are you going to do?,I'll give you the night,to think things over,,but at midday tomorrow I,should be waiting for you,on the number two platform,at Hyde Park corner.,If you're not there, my,next stop will be Keen.,Don't bother to get up,,I'll let myself out.,After all, I let myself in.,How about another drink Coutts?,No thanks.,Well stone me.,What's the matter?,This must be my night.,I won't have a drink, thanks,,but I could do with a,packet of cigarettes.,Oh here, I've got plenty.,No, I meant a new packet.,Sally Jennings.,I wonder.,What time does this place close?,Two, I suppose.,Why?,Well she'll be busy then,how would you like to go for a little walk,over to 24 Lartsbur Street.,Waiter.,The check please.,Someone must have let,him through the side door.,No one will know, Yotti, you're certain.,Yeah, alright.,I will come at once after the show.,Miss, miss.,You have perhaps some French cigarettes?,Pardon, sir?,French cigarettes.,No I'm afraid not sir.,These are very nice though.,Ah, let me see.,Do not worry too much about Keen.,Your friend Ridgeway has been gone,to hide elsewhere for a while.,Who are you?,Let us say just,someone who is interested,in the new employee here, Yotti Blum.,These will do fine, thank you.,You were right.,These are Ridgeway's.,Ah, it had to be.,Don't see it helps us much though.,What do you mean?,It's not my place to criticise,,but aren't we barking,up the wrong tree a bit?,Well we're looking for a murderer.,That's the Yard's job.,We're supposed to be,looking for an impostor,named Dumetrius.,Exactly, but don't you,see he won't make a move,while Ridgeway is on the loose.,See, you're using him as the bait.,To draw Dumetrius,out into the open, yes.,Either Ridgeway is a fool,or he's setting a trap for us.,He is no fool, he found me.,Yes, that in itself,requires an explanation.,Someone showed him the way,to get in to your,dressing room at the club.,Yotti?,It must have been at the side entrance.,He did not come in at the front.,I must check that staff catalogue.,Ugh, what does it matter,how he found his way in,,this should never have happened.,Hedy, sit down and listen.,Ridgeway has signed his own death warrant.,Tomorrow we shall finish what was not done,at Bailey's Hotel.,How, you do not even know where he is.,Thanks to you I know where he will be.,Number two platform, Hyde Park,corner at midday tomorrow.,And you want me...,To be at the station?,No.,Yotti and his boys will form,the reception committee.,Yeah, we will.,Do you see at the same time,I want to convince our friend Keen,that you can have no,possible connection with us.,How?,Well first of all, you,yourself are going to tell Keen,about your encounter with Ridgeway,,with certain emissions of course.,I want no part of it.,My dear don't force me to remind you,that if you lose your nerve,you cease to be of use to me.,The world's full of beautiful women,,many of whom would be glad,of your opportunities,,and with my knowledge of your past,it would be as well to obey me.,Alright.,What do you want me to do?,You will phone Keen at,his office tomorrow morning,and tell him you have news of Ridgeway.,Get him to your flat and keep him there,until 10 minutes past 12 exactly.,Wait here Coutts.,Not at the flat?,This is near enough.,But darling, why didn't,you get in touch with me,right away last night?,When I came down from my dressing room,you had already left the club.,That's right.,Me out looking for Ridgeway,and all that time he's,up there threatening you.,I thought he was going to,kill me like he killed Godowski.,You know he could of, and,gotten away with it too.,Then if that isn't what he wanted,why did he come to club at all?,He must be crazy or something, hm.,What did he want?,Well he wanted to know what I had to say,about the man on the plane.,But that doesn't make sense.,Why should he want to meet you again?,Well maybe he wants,to kill me down there,at the underground, eh?,Oh darling, whatever Ridgeway's,cooking up he's finished.,And he's not getting after you either.,Darling I'm afraid.,No, don't you worry,,we'll take care of Ridgeway.,Where did he say again?,Uh Gloucester Road Platform number two.,I'll get Frand to take care of it.,May I use your phone?,This is an emergency,,Inspector Frand please.,Frand, this is Keen, Crossbow.,I'm in trouble.,I want you to send every man you can spare,down to Gloucester Road tube station.,Yes, right now.,Cover all entrances and exits.,I want you to pick up Peter Ridgeway.,Darling, do you really have,to go to this rehearsal?,I must.,You do not think it is safe?,Well no use taking a chance.,Look, why don't you let,Coutts and me drive you over.,He's parked right down the street.,No, no, no, you run along,,I'll get a taxi, I'll be alright.,You sure?,Mhm.,After him, Coutts!,Here you are.,Have a sip of this, you'll be alright.,Darling it was a bluff then?,All that business, he,meant to get me here.,Were you able to see,who was driving though?,I only caught a glimpse,of him, but enough.,I think it was Peter Ridgeway.,My dear fellow it,couldn't have been Ridgeway.,At that precise moment,he was being attacked on that,platform at Hyde Park corner.,Wait, where?,Hyde Park corner.,And for some reason or,other you sent Frand's men,off to Gloucester Road.,I don't get it.,I'm afraid I do, Keen.,You're being fooled up to the limit.,And it doesn't do to let,your heart rule your head,in this game.,Hedy had nothing to do with it.,I have a strong feeling,that she was keeping you out,of the way whilst the Dumetrius' thugs,were trying to push,Ridgeway under a train,,unsuccessfully, as it turned out.,She can't be working with,Dumetrius, don't you see,,they tried to kill her too, didn't they.,Yes also unsuccessfully.,That one was put on to your benefit.,That's why she sent for you,,to make sure you'd be there as a witness.,Oh, I don't believe it.,You don't want to believe it.,Look you stand in the street,and I'll take the buttons of,your coat at 70 miles an hour,as long as I know you're going to jump.,Sir.,I saw who was driving it.,It was Yotti Blum.,Yotti.,Did you get the number?,PYK388.,It wasn't a false plate.,How do you know?,I checked at the Yard.,Belonged to a Dr. Buchmann,,at Fairview Road, Hampstead.,And was reported stolen,just after midnight.,Yes, but anyone can make one mistake.,And you've made yours Marsotti.,When I engaged you to run that club,I told you not to engage anyone,who's papers I hadn't,personally dealt with.,But you don't think I give,this cigarette girl a job,only because...,With your reputation,since I dragged you out,of the slums of Naples,,nothing would surprise me.,But, all the others,,waiters, commissioner,,they was all selected by you.,Yes, except this girl.,This Sally something.,She's the only one who,could have shown Ridgeway in,by the side door.,You wish me to question her?,Wish?,I order you.,And I'm sending Yotti to help you.,Between you find out,where Ridgeway is now.,Obviously this girl is in touch with him,,and we've got to get him before Keen does.,Ms. Bergner here?,No.,She came to rehearsal, but she's left.,What about Marsotti, is he in?,What do you want with him?,That's my business.,He has someone with him.,I thought he might have.,Through here, isn't it?,It's private in there.,It is?,Look bud, don't try to stop,me or you might get hurt.,And if you start calling,your little playmates,you will get hurt.,Now look, if you let this,guy in then you know him, huh?,Now, where is he?,For the last time, I don't know,and I wouldn't tell you if I did.,Yotti has ways to make you talk.,A nice young girl here, alone, with us.,Don't you dare touch me.,I touch you.,- No, no!,- Sit there baby.,Now look, you let Ridgeway in, didn't you?,You let him in, didn't you?,She didn't let me in Marsotti.,Who are you?,It's Keen.,Yah, now I give you a quick one, hm?,Oh no you don't!,You guys are out of shape.,How about another round?,Yeah, yeah we have one some night.,And you, you finished a pulp.,Yeah, sure.,Santa Maria.,Alright, save your,crying woes out of you.,Now that I think of it you,can pay Sally her wages,,she's leaving.,You think I'd pay this...,You bet you will, in cash too.,How much do you get a week Sally?,Seven pounds and tips.,Alright, come on,Marsotti, let's have it.,Come on.,Here take 10 pounds,,it'll cover the tips.,Alright, move.,Get the keys Sally.,So long you two heroes.,And next time don't try,to push girls around.,And you can take that out of your salary.,24 Lartsbur Street.,Well I think we were pretty lucky,to get out of that mess in one piece.,And how you happened to be there.,I don't know what to say.,I'm just glad I could be of help.,It was horrible, the two,of them against me like that.,And I wouldn't have told them.,You mean where Ridgeway is?,That is what they were,trying to find out, isn't it?,I don't suppose you'd,care to tell me, would ya?,I guess it wouldn't be very fair.,Let me tell you something,about Ridgeway first.,We know now that he didn't knife Godowski.,He's absolutely in the clear.,But we would like to keep,him behind some iron bars.,Why?,For his own protection.,I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.,Oh now Sally, after that little argument,back at the club just now,I think you should be able,to trust me, don't you?,Oh come on now, where is Ridgeway?,He's hiding out at Gade's Warehouse,,East India docks.,Ridgeway?,Ridgeway?,Jolly little devil.,Put up the sign proceed with caution.,And put up your hands as,well, no don't turn around.,I'm just behind you, armed.,I plan to take him seriously.,Walked right in to it, huh?,Major Keen.,I didn't recognise you,from the back gentleman.,A complete misunderstanding.,I took you for Dumetrius' thugs.,Who are you?,A citizen of France, Paul Bonnet.,Like you, I am seeking Dumetrius.,But, let us go into the,office and talk as friends.,We were told Ridgeway was here, is he?,Yes, what is more I have convinced him,that Yotti Blum it was,that murdered the American,,and he has nothing,further to fear from you.,Well we both seem to be,thinking along the same lines.,Good, we shall not be disturbed here,and I can tell you a good,deal that will be of interest.,You mean about Dumetrius?,Yes.,He is a man that I've,hunted for many years.,I have a personal quarrel with him,that need not concern us here.,He was a left tenant of,Hindler and the guest of Foe.,Go on.,I followed him to,Bucharest, Madrid, Marce,,but always he escaped me.,And then one day in Berlin I met a man.,Yotti Blum, a professional murderer.,But the commies aid, he knew,what lead me to Dumetrius.,And what brings them to London?,That I also discovered in Berlin.,Somewhere in this city is a huge treasure,,to be precise 12 million American dollars.,12 million, good grief.,Yes 12 million, almost of it.,Some has already been,passed through the banks,without question.,It is counterfeit, of course?,Naturally.,But not expertly.,You recollect during the war,that the Nazi consider the idea,of ruining the English economy,by printing fast quantities,of spools and pans,of England notes?,Yes, but Intelligence cracked that plot,before the money was ever distributed.,Exactly, but that notion,appealed to the Nazi,,so they also printed huge,quantities of American money.,The Germans are masters of such technique.,So you have a huge fortune,in real American money,somewhere in London.,It is that that Dumetrius seeks.,But he hasn't got it yet.,No, he never makes a move,until he has covered his tracks.,'Til he's sure that no,one can identify him.,That is the danger to Peter Ridgeway.,Who can describe him, eh?,Might be an idea to have him in.,Oh it's alright, he's,in the clear with us.,That right, Major?,Sure, come on let's talk to him.,Peter, it is safe.,You come now.,Your task is very simple Marsotti.,At exactly 4:15 I want you to,telephone Gade's Warehouse,,East India dock, and,ask for Peter Ridgeway.,And then?,Tell him that Sally Jennings,,your former cigarette girl,,wants to talk to him urgently.,But I cannot get this,girl, she's gone from here.,I know that is of the,slightest importance.,All I need is for you to have,him hang on to that telephone,for at least three minutes.,I should ring it at 4:15, huh?,Not one minute before or after.,Understood?,Sure, sure, you want to check my watch?,Well I must say my leave has,been most enjoyable so far.,I've been hit on the,head, accused of murder,,hidden in basements and warehouses,,pushed under trains,,and now you want me to spend,the rest of my leave in gaol?,Better there than in a coffin, Peter.,Yes I know, but I wish you'd hurry up,and catch this Dumetrius fellow.,I want to see at least one show,before I go back to Germany.,We'll try to accommodate now,that we have your description,of him it may help.,How difficult it is to locate the money.,Where that is, there will come Dumetrius.,I will answer it.,Hello, hello.,Who is this?,Ah, one moment.,It is for you Peter, Sally,Jennings with an urgent message.,Sally, ringing here?,Oh it's probably from Digby Mitchel.,Thank you.,Hello?,No miss, don't cut me off,,I'm waiting for somebody.,Coutts, stay away from that window.,Must have come from the,rooftop across the street.,Oh dear, can we not harp him, huh?,Not a chance in that rabbit world.,You alright Ridgeway?,Yes, apart from a,slight desire to be sick.,They parted my hair but,they didn't score a goal.,Stay away from that window,,they may try a second shot.,Don't worry, I have every,intention of doing so.,Fun, fun.,Coutts I got it,,this is exactly what,we've been waiting for,and what Dumetrius has been waiting for.,Let's get Mullins at the press department.,Ah, dearest day, how,charming of you to wait.,Not at all, I've just been,passing time with the paper.,Dreadful thing this,here office has murder.,Most distressing,,the world seems to be,full of crooks these days.,It does indeed, Mr. Rubenstein.,It is Max Rubenstein?,At your service, my dear fellow.,And now what can I do to oblige you.,I believe you have a John,Ramey, a Madonna and group.,Now I don't know Ramey,well, tell me about him.,Well he is not without merit you know.,The Madonna belongs to his second period.,Some say it is not his best work,,but it's far from being his worst.,Then the price should,be a reasonable one.,I should like to pay,with American dollars.,Where are they?,Yanis?,What did you say?,My name is Max Rubenstein.,Your name is Armal Yanis.,You are a collaborator, were you not?,An informer for the Gestapo,,outwardly posing as a hero for,the Free French Resistance.,Is not true, there is no proof.,I'm Max Rubenstein.,I have papers.,I have papers too.,I obtained them from,the Gestapo headquarters,in Berlin.,Would you like me to send,them to the Paris authorities?,Your countrymen have long memories.,It will mean they kill a team, you know.,I do not believe you Mr. Delahey.,Where are these papers?,Here, read them.,There's even a note from Himler,to say nothing of your photograph.,So you know it all.,Exactly, where is the money?,What matter of man you take me for.,For years I have risked death,and torture to get this money.,I played side against side and I survived,while the agents of 10,countries searched for it.,You really think I would,give it up so easily now?,I'm sure you would.,For say half, I'm a reasonable man.,You don't understand,,I'm only the custodian,I have partners.,Any one of them would kill,me if I betrayed them.,I know them too.,Meyer in Paris, Ruber in Rome,,Carti and Fasha in Madrid.,They wouldn't seek revenge on a dead man.,So, you intend to kill me?,Would that be wise without the secret?,In Berlin I disposed of somebody,because he happened to bear a,superficial resemblance to me.,His name was Scamel.,You mean...,That it could happen again?,Yes.,I have the good fortune,to command the services,of a number of displaced,persons whose papers I forged.,One of them could be made to resemble you.,Who exactly are you?,My name is Dumetrius.,Dumetrius.,Your reputation is known,to me my dear fellow.,This thing would have to,be arranged with finesse.,It could be arranged with,finesse for 12 million dollars.,And instead of your,share being a one fifth,it would be one half.,And how would you arrange it?,You have a country house,up Crabtree in Norfolk.,On the way to it the lane,takes a difficult bend round,the top of a disused quarry.,Ah, I'm flattered by the,attention you have paid me.,I believe in being informed.,You will have an exit,and as you fail to round,that bend in your car.,Excellent.,I shall of course have to,insist on seeing this man first,and also I'll be present at the exhibit.,Obviously.,And so you shall see that man.,At Dr. Buchmann's house,,the Lottos Fairview Road, Hampstead.,Shall we say tomorrow, three o'clock?,I will make a note of it.,And now as proof of your good faith,I should like to see...,The money, but of course.,The John Ramey, to which,you were referring,,will find of some interest.,12 million.,Well, six each.,What can I say?,For the first time in my life,I have met a man who can give me real love,and now it's too late.,Oh save it darling.,I am in love with you darling,,that at least you must believe.,How can I believe it?,God knows I'm in love with you Hedy,,but can't you see that,everything you've ever said to me,has been a lie?,Ah, they all warned me.,Coutts, Fentriss, Mitchel.,But I wouldn't believe them.,And now Ridgeway, he,has opened your eyes.,That's right.,You had agreed to meet,him at Hyde Park corner.,No, no, darling it was Gloucester Road.,No, save it.,You said Gloucester Road so,I'd send the police there,while Yotti Blum tried to,kill him at Hyde Park corner.,I was afraid he would tell you.,About getting Godowski's,address at the airport?,Yeah, now that's something,you didn't tell me,even after they left, why not?,'Cause I was afraid.,Afraid of what?,You.,Me?,You represent authority.,I grew up in Vietnam,,before the Auschwitz,,when I was a little girl.,I was chased by the hoodlums in the street,while the police laughed.,My father, he was a concert musician,,and they broke his hands,and made him work in the stone quarries.,We were hounded and impoverished,because we were against the dictatorship.,I grew up afraid of authority.,Can't you understand that darling?,Yes, I can understand all that.,But what about that car,that nearly ran you down?,You said it was driven by Ridgeway,,when actually it was driven by Yotti Blum,,who takes his orders from Dumetrius.,What can I say now?,There's nothing to,be said, it's too late.,Quite a reasonable likeness.,How useful to be able to find such a type.,There were times when,the forged paper business was tedious,but it's paid dividends.,And now, the rest of your plans?,You and I will leave,for Norfolk in your car.,We'll have this fellow with us.,When we arrive at the quarry,we'll dispose of them both,and return to your gallery.,How?,Yotti Blum with follow in Buchmann's car,and wait for us on the main road.,The marks of a second set of tyres,'round the quarry wouldn't do.,Naturally.,The position as I see it is this,,in a few hours time, to,all intents and purposes,you will be dead.,You'll no longer have four partners,to take into consideration.,You and I will divide the money.,And go our seperate ways.,Are we so busy we can,not call on our solicitors,and draw up a deed of partnership?,We already have an official agreement.,If you fail me I can always,tell the French Embassy,about you.,If I fail you, you now know,my London headquarters,,my only hideout.,I'm afraid my precautions,have been more elaborate.,If I am not alive in 24 hours from now,and report of my accidental death,has not been published,in the morning papers,a full account of myself,and my dealings with you,will go to the authorities.,Why have you done this?,Just in case you,should have decide to kill me,out of hand, here.,Before you've given me the,combination to the Madonna?,My dear fellow.,True, that knowledge is my insurance.,But in the event of,anything happening to me,it will be Scotland yard,who will collect the money,,and who will pay a visit here.,The police must not come here.,Quiet Buchmann.,So, we appear to be in,one another's hands.,Precisely.,If what Monseigneur,Bonnet tells us is true,,and I see no reason to doubt it,,we have mighty few hours,left to clear this thing up.,Now that he believes,Mr. Ridgeway to be dead,he will move quickly to obtain the money.,This thing's on an international level.,Believe you me, the,United States government,are going to take a pretty,dim view of our security,if we let some rat slip,through our fingers,with 12 million phoney dollars.,We could have Interpol warn the banks.,There'll be no need for that.,That load is never going,to leave this country.,And neither is Dumetrius.,We should have held Yotti Blum.,No Keen, you should,have held Hedy Bergner.,And not in your arms either.,I'd have staked my life on her.,How many more lives,do you propose to stake?,Not in it.,Who got Godowski's address?,Who lied about Ridgeway?,Who worked for Marsotti,,the character who was bullying a girl,with the help of Yotti Blum?,No Keen, she's part of a gang.,A gang led by a man,who's butchered his way,half across Europe.,And whom it's up to you to get.,You are quite sure,the police will discover,the accident quickly?,I've already made arrangements.,Would have been better,to wait 'til nightfall,for one of these charming English fogs.,Better excuse for losing my way.,I shall literally wait until after dark,before I inform them,,by which time I hope to,be on my way to Portugal.,You're quite sure this fellow,will not regain consciousness?,Buchmann's given him an,injection of Sodium Pentothal,,he won't disturb us.,Meanwhile, a few personal trinkets.,Cigarette case, wallet,,and some Christopher,to speed him on his journey.,I commend you on your caution Mr. Yanis.,Now help me get him out of the car.,Now the wallet.,Should we put the lights on?,Night, remember.,They'd be smashed anyway,,but please yourself.,Pity to sacrifice such a splendid car,but you'll be able to buy any,number of them to replace it.,But you, my friend, will buy nothing.,So, you've decided to,make other arrangements?,I did.,Did you really think I would let you,touch one frank of that money?,I shall remember you with,gratitude my dear fellow,for providing me with the,means of avoiding my partners,and getting away with not one fifth,nor one half of the loot, but all of it.,Gassner!,Quickly.,Get the things back into his pocket.,Now, get him into the driving,seat and start the car.,Quick, the keys.,Right, latch off, let her go.,Come on.,Get it out Yotti.,It's heavy.,So it should be with 12 million dollars.,You have seen it?,I've seen it Yotti.,Now get it to the car and,come back here a minute.,It's only taken a minute.,We look at 12 million, eh?,Why not?,Here.,Got me, oh my!,Newspapers.,So he fooled you at the last.,You should have killed,him here at the first day,,like I said.,But no, you are saying Yotti,do this, Yotti do that.,Kill Scamel, kill Godowski, kill Ridgeway.,No is for nothing.,You unclean cretin.,You come from the sewers,where you are bred,and you raise your voice at me now.,One more speech like that,and I'll kill you too

alike, entered the,same, but not the one we want.,We go now to Victoria?,Yes, before Rubinstein's,report reaches Scotland Yard.,The Norfolk police found,the body about one AM,and this arrived 10 minutes ago.,I am, perhaps, intruding?,Far from it Monseigneur,,after all it was a fellow,countryman of yours, Armal Yanis,,who wrote this.,Yanis of the Resistance?,And it seems of the fifth column.,No.,However he provides,us with two vital clues.,First of the money contained,in a large black trunk,painted with two white bands,is in the left luggage office at Victoria.,And the second?,That the London headquarters,of these people is,,or rather was, Dr. Buchmann's sanitarium,,Fairview Road, Hampstead.,That was where that car came from.,The one Blum drove with Ms. Bergner.,It was reported stolen, remember?,I only hope this,hasn't arrived too late.,They've got several hours start on us,,but we may get them yet.,Keen you and Monseigneur,Bonnet get up to Hampstead,and go armed.,A precaution I usually,take, as Major Keen knows.,Yeah that's the car alright,,the one that nearly ran down Hedy.,Perhaps they have not yet flown.,We'll soon find out.,Come on, let's try around the back.,It would seem we are too late.,Wait a minute.,Even their own people.,And with his own hypodermic.,Had we not better search,the rest of the house?,Right.,Stick around down here,,I'll have a look upstairs.,Not a soul, not even a patient.,But I think perhaps a clue.,Hm, what do you mean?,You are a musician, Major Keen?,This music it is of,Svorski, the Gypsy Rhapsody.,The piece she played at the club.,Exactly.,But an additional bar has been added,,and quite recently I think.,Let me see.,Andante Moderato.,GADE.,Look at these marks.,AMAT, M at GADE, gade.,Gade?,I have it, Gade's
